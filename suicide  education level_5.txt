There are tens of bootcamps on Clapham Common, all of which focus on hour long sessions, bodyweight exercises, or jogging.
This group is for people who are interested in doing short, high intensity sessions lasting 3-45 minutes, to get fit and lose weight.
These types of session have been proved in numerous studies to be far superior to moderate intensity sessions. Trouble is, you have to push yourself hard. Doing that on your own is tough.
This group is for people who don't have an hour to spare, want to train that little bit harder, want to see excellent fat loss results without losing muscle, and want to have fun doing it.
All fitness levels are catered for, so don't worry if you haven't done anything like this before.  
What will a typical session look like?
A session will last no more than 30 minutes. Working at a high intensity it simply isn't possible to do any longer. It will typically involve sprinting type exercises. These are the best for releasing growth hormone, and generating an after-burn effect which burns calories for up to 24 hours after the session.
Each exercise will be performed for a short duration followed by a longer rest period.
An example session might be sprinting across a football pitch, walking back x 10.
Or performing 10 sets of suicide runs.
Although the sessions will be hard work, we'll try and mix in some games and group exercises to make things fun.
Who runs it?
I do. My name is Ed and I live in Clapham. I've done other bootcamps on the common but they were too expensive and didn't fit my style of explosive, short duration training. And so I created this group to have some fun doing high intensity interval training.
