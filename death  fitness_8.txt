Donations to the fundraising page of a woman who collapsed and died near the end of the London Marathon have reached more than £350,000 following a wave of interest in her story.
The family of Claire Squires, who was running Sunday's event to raise money for the Samaritans, described the 30-year-old as "incredible, inspirational, beautiful and driven", and urged the public to continue donating.
Squires had competed in the event once before and was in apparent good health before she collapsed in the final stretch of the race. Immediate medical attention was provided but paramedics were unable to revive her.
Squires, from North Kilworth in Leicestershire, fell as she ran up Birdcage Walk, near St James's Park. It is the final road the runners take before reaching Buckingham Palace and turning on to The Mall. The cause of death is not yet known.
As news of Squires's death spread via social media sites, so did the link to her Just Giving fundraising page, on which she had written: "It's a fab opportunity to raise money for my charity the Samaritans". Donations, which initially stood at £500, rose rapidly throughout Monday, passing £200,000. Shortly after 10am on Tuesday they passed £300,000, and then exceeded £330,000.
In a statement, her family said Squires "was loved by so many and is dearly missed by all of us".
They said: "On behalf of Claire's family and all those who knew and loved her – we would like to say thank you so much for everyone's support.
"Claire would be so happy and overwhelmed with the incredible support that has been offered by thousands of people from all over the world. Her family appreciate the kind messages posted online very much."
They added: "For Claire and the Samaritans, please keep the donations coming. Don't stop giving, just like her. It's what she would have wanted."
Catherine Johnstone, the chief executive of the Samaritans, said the charity had been overwhelmed by the response.
"Claire chose to run the marathon for Samaritans as her mother, Cilla Squires, has been a volunteer for the charity for 24 years," Johnstone said. "This is an incredibly sad time for Claire's family and all those who knew her.
"We desperately wish that it was not under these circumstances but we have been overwhelmed by the response from people donating in Claire's memory. These donations will be put into a tribute fund and, following discussions with the family, will go towards projects they feel would have been important to Claire."
In March, Squires, a hairdresser at the Moko hair salon in Market Harborough, had climbed Mount Kilimanjaro to raise money for the Royal Air Force Association.
Callie Wright tweeted: "RIP Claire Squires – lived life to the full. Only lady I know to take hair straighteners up a mountain!" Friends left messages on her Facebook page. Lillie Renshaw-Booth wrote: "Thoughts with you. Can't believe it. She was so healthy."
Around 37,500 runners took part in the marathon. A London Ambulance Service spokesman said: "Our staff attended a 30-year-old woman on Birdcage Walk as part of the event and took the patient to hospital as a priority."
The results of tests to establish why Squires collapsed are expected in the coming days. Her death is the 10th since the marathon began in 1981. Five were runners with heart disease, four of whom had severe coronary disease, who were unaware of their condition. The most recent death was that of David Rogers, a 22-year-old fitness instructor, in 2007.
A statement on the London Marathon website said: "The organisers of the Virgin London Marathon would like to express their sincere condolences to the family and friends of the deceased.
"We would like to emphasise that our immediate concern is for the family of the deceased. Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with them."
