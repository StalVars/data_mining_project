 The mechanism of tyranny always has to have both an external and an internal enemy to thrive. And it doesn't matter how contrived the internal enemy is or for that matter the external one. Tyranny is always the last refuge of a culture, civilization, or nation in decline. It never ever works. […] It's an epistomological warfare [between the Hermetic/Platonic view or the materialistic/Asristotelean view].  Audio interview with Joseph P.

 Grundsätze der Gewaltfreien Kommunikation – Marshall Rosenberg


Empfehlungen für gewaltfreies Kommunizieren

Höre anderen empathisch [zugewandt und freundlich] zu. 
Verbinde dich empathisch mit anderen, ehe du sie informierst [ihnen erklärst, sie erziehst]. 
Formuliere klare Bitten, stelle keine Forderungen. 
Höre die Bedürfnisse [nicht die Wünsche] und Gefuehle, die den Gedanken zugrundeliegen. 
Überhöre die Gedanken, gehe nicht auf Erwartungen von anderen ein. 
Gehe keine Kompromisse ein. 
Alle Bedürfnisse können erfüllt werden.Die Bedürfnisse der Mitmenschen können ohne dich erfüllt werden.
Niemand ist falschKorrekte Übersetzung: Niemand hat unrecht.
Niemand kann die schmerzlichen Gefühle eines anderen verursachen.

 Vergewaltigungsstatistik in Deutschland


In Deutschland sind rund 90% der Opfer von Sexualdelikten Frauen, 10% Männer.
In Deutschland finden täglich etwa 400 Vergewaltigungen statt. [Stand 2005]1
13% der Frauen und Mädchen zwischen 16-85 Jahren in Deutschland haben sexualisierte Gewalt erlebt, die nach der engen juristischen Definition als Straftat gilt.2
14,5% aller Frauen wurden mindestens einmal im Leben Opfer eines sexuellen Übergriffs. Deutschland, Stand 19953
15-25% aller Frauen werden mindestens einmal im Lauf ihres Lebens vergewaltigt.4 und 5
 
Es gibt insgesamt 5,33 Millionen erwachsene weibliche Opfer von Sexualdelikten in Deutschland. Jährlich kommt es zu 70.000 bis 140.000 Vergewaltigungen in Deutschland, die zu knapp 10% angezeigt werden.6
Es wurden rund 8000 sexuelle Straftaten jährlich angezeigt. [BRD, Stand 2004]
Es wurden rund 7000 (versuchte) Vergewaltigungen jährlich angezeigt. [BRD, Stand 1981]7
Rund 1000 (13%) der angezeigten Sexualstraftäter wurden verurteilt. [BRD, Stand 2004]
Rund 700 (10%) der angezeigten Sexualstraftäter wurden verurteilt. [BRD, Stand 1981]
 
Laut Dunkelfeldstudien ist die Anzahl der Opfer von sexuellen Kindesmissbrauch erheblich. Nur etwa 10% der angezeigten Fälle enden mit einer Verurteilung.8
 
Ungefähr 8000 Anzeigen von Vergewaltigung und sexueller Nötigung erfolgen jährlich in Deutschland.9
Von ca. 8000 Anzeigen gibt es jährlich 1040 verurteilte Täter.10
7511 Fälle von Vergewaltigung oder schwerer sexueller Nötigung wurden angezeigt.11
Die Verurteilungsquote ca. 13% – in Fällen von Vergewaltigung und sexueller Nötigung.
Es kommt jährlich zu 1365 Anklagen / Gerichtsverhandlungen mit insgesamt 1053 Verurteilungen.12
Bei etwa 77% der verhandelten Sexualdeliktsfällen wurde der Täter verurteilt.13
 
Aufklärungsquote von sexuellen Gewaltverbrechen: 83% 14
Bei ~6640 von 8000 Anzeigen ist der Täter ermittelbar.
Von 7.475 der Vergewaltigung Verdächtigen waren 98,8% männlich und 1,2 % weiblich.Der Anteil deutscher Tatverdächtiger beträgt 69,4%, der der ausländischen Verdächtigen 30,6%15
Etwa 1360 = 17% der Anzeigen sind nicht strafverfolgbar, da kein Tatverdächtiger (Fremdtäter) ermittelt werden kann. 
Gemessen an den ermittelten Tatverdächtigen, liegt die Verurteilungsquote bei ~15,7% (statt 13%), wenn 1040 Tatverdächtige verurteilt wurden. 
 
In Deutschland kommt es jährlich zu rund 3% Falschbezichtigungen bei sexuellen Straftaten.16
Etwa 240 der in Deutschland angezeigten Sexualstrafdelikte jährlich sind bewusste Falschverdächtigungen.
Gegen 4,8% der "Opfer" bzw. Anzeigenden wurde wegen des Straftatbestands der falschen Verdächtigung ermittelt, meist ohne dass der Ausgang der Ermittlungen bekannt gegeben wurde.17

 
Weltweit
Weltweit werden mindestens eine von drei Frauen und Mädchen im Lauf ihres Lebens geschlagen oder sexuell missbraucht.18
Rund 39% aller Frauen werden mindestens einmal in ihrem Leben Opfer sexueller Gewalt.19

 
Ein sexuelles Gewaltverbrechen anzuzeigen und vor Gericht zu bringen, bedeutet, das Trauma wieder zu durchleben. (Retraumatisierung)
2% der Anzeigen von Sexualdelikten sind Falschbezichtigungen.
Sobald sich das Opfer auf den Weg der öffentlichen Instanzen begibt, kann der Prozess heilsam sein.Debbie Fox, Oregon Coalition against domestic and sexual violence [Koalition gegen häusliche und sexuelle Gewalt, Oregon, Vereinigte Staaten], Audio of Al Gore sex assault victim released, YouTube film, 2:00 minutes duration, posted 25.

Mythos: Wunsch nach Vergewaltigung


 Der Bielefelder Soziologe Rolf Butzmühlen errechnete aus den Zahlen einer Kinsey-Befragung [~1952] von 7789 Frauen, dass nicht einmal 0,7% aller Interviewten von Vergewaltigung träumten. Kinsey interpretierte, dass es sich eher um Alpträume handelt als um etwas, das der Frau im Schlafen oder im Wachen willkommen wäre.  Vergewaltigung. Mord an der Seele, Der Spiegel, Heft 32, 3. August 1981
 
Die Studie eines Forscherteams der Londoner Metropolitan University zeigt außerdem, dass falsche Beschuldigungen nur ein Randproblem sind. "Entgegen der weit verbreiteten Stereotype, wonach die Quote der Falschanschuldigungen bei Vergewaltigungen beachtlich ist, liegt der Anteil bei nur 3%. Auch in anderen Ländern ist das Problem Falschanschuldigung marginal und rangiert zwischen 1-9%", fanden die Wissenschaftlerinnen Corinna Seith, Joanna Lovett und Liz Kelly heraus.  «Wie wollen Sie authentisch sein?» Bei einem Strafverfahren wegen Vergewaltigung hängt die Anklage oft an einem seidenen Faden. Entscheidend ist die Glaubwürdigkeit des Opfers., präsentiert von 20min.ch/news, Susanne Gabriel, AP, 5. September 2010

 Schockierender Vergewaltigungsrekord in Südafrika

Vergewaltigungsstatistiken belegen, dass Südafrika die höchste Vergewaltigungsrate der Welt aufweist.
Für eine in Südafrika geborene Frau ist es wahrscheinlicher, im Lauf ihres Lebens vergewaltigt zu werden als lesen zu lernen. 
 
Eine Studie des Medical Research Councils (veröffentlicht im Juni 2009) befragte 1.738 Männer aus allen Bevölkerungsgruppen Südafrikas. 27,6% der befragten Männer in Südafrika bestätigten mindestens einmal in ihrem Leben eine Frau oder ein Mädchen vergewaltigt zu haben.
Drei Viertel davon gaben an, sie hätten mit weniger als 20 Jahren erstmals vergewaltigt. Beinahe jeder zehnte Vergewaltiger war zum Zeitpunkt seines ersten Verbrechens jünger als zehn Jahre. Unter den über 30-Jährigen gab es 1,9% Vergewaltiger.
Die Hälfte der Vergewaltiger gestand mehrere Vergewaltigungen ein.
Unter den Vergewaltigern, die Frauen missbraucht haben, waren 20% zum Zeitpunkt der Vergewaltigung HIV-positiv. 2,9% der Befragten gaben an, Männer oder Knaben vergewaltigt zu haben, wovon 27,8% HIV-Positiv waren. 
 
Die südafrikanische Polizeistatistik für das Jahr 2007 notiert 36.190 Anzeigen wegen Vergewaltigung.
Im Jahr 2002 waren laut Polizeistatistik 15% aller Vergewaltigungsopfer Kinder unter 11 Jahren.
 Stand 2008: Von insgesamt 23.562.600 südafrikanischen Männern sind 112.835 (0,48% der männlichen Bevölkerung) im Gefängnis, um für ein Verbrechen zu büßen.

 

Kriminalstatistiken sowie neuro/biologische und anthropologische Gutachten belegen:Junge Männer im Alter von 14-23 sind Angehörige des gewalttätigsten Geschlechts auf Erden.

 Vergewaltigungsmythen


 Vergewaltigung und sexueller Missbrauch – Vorurteile und Tatsachen


 Jede vierte Frau in Deutschland zwischen 16 und 85 Jahren wird wenigstens einmal in ihrem Leben von ihrem Partner oder ihrem Expartner körperlich und sexuell angegriffen.20
Rund 39 % aller Frauen [weltweit] werden mindestens einmal in ihrem Leben Opfer sexueller Gewalt.21 Frauen zwischen 15 und 44 Jahren sind schwerer durch sexuelle Gewalt bedroht als durch Krebs, Krieg und Autounfälle zusammen genommen.
 
Vergewaltigung – jegliches Eindringen in den Körper einer Person gegen ihren Willen – ist die extremste Form sexualisierter Gewalt. Sie missachtet das sexuelle Selbstbestimmungsrecht der Frau und ist Ausdruck männlicher Übermacht durch Unterwerfung und Demütigung von Frauen und Mädchen.
 
Eine Studie zur Vergewaltigungsmythenakzeptanz22 ergab, dass es gesamtgesellschaftlich eine relativ hohe Akzeptanz von Vergewaltigungsmythen gibt.818 Befragten wurde ein Fragebogen nach Gerd Bohners 20-Punkte-Vergewaltigungsmythenakzeptanzskala (VMAS) vorgelegt. Die Ergebnisse sind:
Männer glauben stärker an Vergewaltigungsmythen als Frauen.
Ältere und weniger gebildete MitbürgerInnen glauben stärker an Vergewaltigungsmythen als jüngere. 
Die gesamtgesellschaftliche Aufgabe besteht darin
Sexuelle Gewalt gegen Frauen und Mädchen NICHT als Kavaliersdelikt zu bagatellisieren,
ihre körperlichen und psychologischen Folgen in der Frauenheilkunde zu berücksichtigen und
vergewaltigten Frauen und Männern KEINE Mitschuld bei sexuellen Gewaltverbrechen zuzuschreiben.23

 

༺༻FehleinschätzungT A T S A C H E
1.Vis-haud-ingrata-Theorie / Typ C – Eine Vergewaltigung ist aggressiver Geschlechtsverkehr. Manche Frauen empfinden ihn als "luststeigernd" oder als besonders "männlich".Vergewaltigung ist eine existenzielle Bedrohung, kein sexueller Akt. Sie ist ein massiver Angriff auf die psychische und physische Integrität der missbrauchten Person.
2.Abwehrtheorie / Typ C – Frauen und Mädchen wollen hart genommen werden. Sie genießen es, vergewaltigt werden, sonst würden sie sich wehren.Eine Vergewaltigung erfolgt immer gegen den Willen einer Frau. Sie wird nicht als lustvoll sondern als lebensgefährliche Bedrohung mit akuter Todesangst erlebt.24 Meist führt dies zu einem Schockzustand, in dem eine körperliche Gegenwehr unmöglich ist. Ein NEIN und Gegenwehr wird vom Vergewaltiger übergangen.25
3.Typ C / D – Nur junge, attraktive Frauen oder solche, die sich aufreizend kleiden oder verhalten, werden vergewaltigt.Jedes Mädchen und jede Frau kann unabhängig von ihrem Alter, ihrem Aussehen, ihrer Kleidung, Nationalität oder Religion Opfer einer Vergewaltigung werden. Kein Verhalten kann eine Vergewaltigung ausschließen. Kein Verhalten von Mädchen und Frauen, das eine Vergewaltigung rechtfertigt.
4.Opferabwertung / Typ B – Einer vergewaltigten Frau sieht man den Missbrauch an. Sie erzählt sofort von der Tat.Es gibt kein typisches Opferverhalten. Vergewaltigte reagieren individuell (verzweifelt, ruhig, aggressiv). Das jeweilige Verhalten ist kein Maßstab für Glaubwürdigkeit. Aus Scham, Angst und möglichen Schuldzuweisungen reden nur wenige Vergewaltigte mit nahestehenden oder fremden Personen über das Verbrechen oder erstatten Anzeige.
5.Überfalltheorie Typ D – Vergewaltigungen geschehen meist nachts, überfallartig durch Fremdtäter im Freien.Vergewaltigungen sind zu 70-80% geplant und geschehen rund um die Uhr. Nur 11-22% der Sexualopfer werden von Unbekannten angegriffen. Zwei Drittel aller Vergewaltigungen finden im sozialen Umfeld der Opfer statt. Überwiegend kennen sich Täter und Opfer (zumindest flüchtig). Freunde, Bekannte, Väter, Brüder, Ehemänner, Partner überwältigen in der Familie, im Freundeskreis, am Arbeitsplatz, in der Wohnung des Opfers.
6.Triebtätertheorie – Eine Vergewaltigung ist eine sexuell motivierte Triebtat.Eine Vergewaltigung ist eine aggressiv, nicht sexuell, motivierte Gewalttat. Dieses Verbrechen geschieht aus Wut, Kontrolle und Dominationsmacht. Sie ängstigen, erniedrigen und beschämen.
7.Triebtätertheorie – Vergewaltiger sind anormal, psychisch krank oder sexuell ausgehungert und gestört.Vergewaltiger sind zu über 90% nicht psychopathologisch auffällig.26 Keine biologische, psychische oder physische Veraussetzung untersagt es einem Mann, sein Sexualverhalten zu kontrollieren. Seriöse wissenschaftliche Angaben zu "triebgesteuerten" Männern liegen nicht vor.
8.Typ B – Vergewaltigte Frauen sind mitschuldig an der Tat.Vergewaltiger missachten die Würde und das Selbstbestimmungsrecht ihres Gegenübers. Ein körperlich gesunder und geistig zurechnungsfähiger Mensch ist befähigt, jederzeit und in allen Situationen abzuweisen. Sein NEIN gilt auch, wenn das Opfer zuvor zärtlich oder sexuell mit Täter verkehrte. Die rechtliche Verantwortung für den Missbrauch liegt aufseiten des Täters. Angesichts aller Verbrechen trägt die ganze Gesellschaft Mitverantwortung.
9.Opferabwertung / Typ A – Viele Anzeigen wegen Vergewaltigung sind Falschbezichtigungen aus Rache.In Deutschland sind 3% der Anzeigen gegen Vergewaltiger Falschbeschuldigungen, in den Vereinigten Staaten 2%. Aus Angst und Scham verzichten Missbrauchte auf eine Anzeige. Je näher sie mit dem Täter bekannt oder verwandt sind, desto seltener zeigen Frauen eine Vergewaltigung an.
10.Opferabwertung / Typ D – Theorien, wie sich Frauen zu verhalten haben, um der Vergewaltigung zu entgehen.Eine Vergewaltigte befindet sich in Lebensgefahr. Hier empfiehlt sich, dem eigenen Instinkt zu folgen. Erfolg ist, mit dem Leben davonzukommen.
11.Omnipotenz-Theorie –Theorie, dass Männer sich stets gegen sexuelle Gewalt wehren können.Ein Vergewaltigter befindet sich in Lebensgefahr. Hier empfiehlt sich, dem eigenen Instinkt zu folgen.

༺༻Zentrale MythenVerleugnung, Cliche, Rechtfertigung
Typ-AEs ist nichts passiert.27Verleugnung des sexuellen Kontakts zwischen Täter und Opfer.Umkehrung des Täter-Opfer-Verhältnisses [Falschbezichtigung] – Projektion männlicher Phantasien (femme fatale) auf FrauenNur rund 1% der Gewalttäter werden verurteilt. Demnach hat auch keine Vergewaltigung stattgefunden.Folge: Bei Gerichtsverhandlungen wird die Glaubwürdigkeit des Opfers stärker als bei anderen Delikten thematisiert. Vergewaltigungsstudie Susan Brownmiller (*1935), 1975
Typ-BDie Vergewaltigung hat keinen Schaden angerichtet.Verleugnung des Schadens durch Vergewaltigung.Durch Übernahme der männlichen Perspektive [Frauen als Besitz des Mannes] wird Vergewaltigung als "normale" sexuelle Interaktion betrachtet.  Vergewaltigungsstudie Susan Brownmiller (*1935), 1975Rechtfertigung: Nur "schlechte Frauen" können vergewaltigt werden.
Typ-CDie Frau wollte vergewaltigt werden.Cliché: Frauen meinen "ja" wenn sie "nein" sagen.Schlussfolgerung: Sie zieren sich, wollen jedoch "hart angepackt werden". Wenn Frauen die Abwehr nicht gelingt, haben sie eingewilligt, vergewaltigt zu werden.

The constant novelty-at-a-click of Internet pornography can lead to Internet addiction in some users' brains. Research on Internet porn addiction reveals the same addiction-related brain changes and severe behavioral and chemical symptoms seen in other addicts. Rates of Internet-addicted male and female test subjects range from 8-21%, depending upon who performed the research. One study on university students broke addiction rates by gender.
A quarter of the young men met the criteria for Internet addiction.
Less than one in ten females met the criteria for Internet addiction.
Former addicts are showing evidence of reversal of symptoms and brain change.

 Gewalttätiges Verhalten ist geschlechtsspezifisch.

Strafrechtsrelevante Gewalt, die den Körper bedroht und verletzt, wird überwiegend von jüngeren Männern ausgeübt.
Entwicklungs- und hormonphysiologisch bedingt begehen im wesentlichen männliche Jugendliche und junge Erwachsene (vorwiegend Vierzehn- bis Zwanzigjährige) Gewaltverbrechen.
Der Hypothalamus von Männern und Frauen weist einen deutlichen Sexualdimorphismus auf. Nur bei Männern besteht eine Koppelung von sexueller Erregung, Aggressivität und Dominanzverhalten. In Verbindung mit einem signifikant erhöhten Testosteronspiegel und einem deutlich gesenkten Serotoninspiegel verüben prädisponierte Männer Gewalttaten. Serotonin, Oxytocin und das Neuropeptid Y tragen zur Beruhigung und zur Aggressionskontrolle bei.
 
In Deutschland gab es im Jahr 1997 Verurteilungen wegen folgender Verbrechen:
Gewaltverbrechen – 658.943 Männer und 121.587 Frauen
Gefährliche und schwere Körperverletzung – 16.338 Männer und 1.255 Frauen
Sexueller Missbrauch von Kindern – 2.179 Männer und 28 Frauen
Vergewaltigung – 1.002 Männer und 7 Frauen
Mord und Totschlag (schwere Gewaltdelikte) – 734 Männer und 70 Frauen34

 Zitate allgemein
Jesus:  Siehe, ich sende euch wie Schafe mitten unter die Wölfe; darum seid klug wie die Schlangen und ohne Falsch wie die Tauben.  Matthäus 10, 16 und Paulus, 1. Korinther 14, 20 (NT)
 
 Da sprach Jesus zu ihm [dem gewaltbereiten Apostel Petrus]: Stecke dein Schwert an seinen Ort; denn wer das Schwert nimmt, der soll durchs Schwert umkommen.  Matthäus 26, 52 (NT)
 

Persönliche Bekenntnisse
In dieser Zeit, wo Gewalttätigkeit, in Lüge gekleidet, so unheimlich wie noch nie auf dem Throne der Welt sitzt, bleibe ich dennoch überzeugt, dass Wahrheit, Liebe, Friedfertigkeit, Sanftmut und Gütigkeit die Gewalt sind, die über aller Gewalt ist. Ihnen wird die Welt gehören, wenn nur genug Menschen die Gedanken der Liebe, der Wahrheit, der Friedfertigkeit und der Sanftmut rein und stark und streng genug denken und leben.  Albert Schweitzer (1875-1965) deutsch-elsässischer Arzt, evangelischer Theologe, medizinischer Missionar, Kulturphilosoph, Humanist, Organist, Friedensnobelpreisträger, 1952, Autor, Albert Schweitzer: Selbstzeugnisse.

Was man mit Gewalt gewinnt, kann man nur mit Gewalt behalten.

Schlussfolgerungen von Marshall Rosenberg
Kein anderer kann Gefühle in dir verursachen. Ein anderer kann Gefühle auslösen. Es ist jedoch dein Denken darüber, was er tun sollte oder müsste beziehungsweise, was man tut, was korrekt oder richtig ist, das deine Gefühle von Wut, Schmerz oder Ärger verursacht.  Marshall B. Rosenberg (1934-2015) US-amerikanischer Psychologe, Psychotherapeut, Entwickler der Gewaltfreien Kommunikation, Quelle unbekannt
 
Alle Gewalt ist das Ergebnis davon, dass Menschen [...] auf das Denkmuster hereinfallen, dass ihr Schmerz von anderen Menschen herrührt und es diese Menschen konsequenterweise verdienen, bestraft zu werden.  Marshall B. Rosenberg (1934-2015) US-amerikanischer Psychologe, Psychotherapeut, Entwickler der Gewaltfreien Kommunikation, Gewaltfreie Kommunikation. Eine Sprache des Lebens, Junfermann, 9. Auflage 12. Februar 2007
 
Du kannst entweder Recht haben oder glücklich sein, beides geht nicht.  Marshall B. Rosenberg (1934-2015) US-amerikanischer Psychologe, Psychotherapeut, Entwickler der Gewaltfreien Kommunikation, Quelle unbekannt
 
Schlussfolgerung
Gewalt kann nur durch eine Lüge verborgen werden, und die Lüge kann nur durch Gewalt aufrechterhalten werden, und die Lüge kann nur durch Gewalt aufrecht erhalten werden. Wer Gewalt zu seiner Methode erkoren hat, ist unweigerlich gezwungen, die Lüge als sein Prinzip anzuerkennen.  Alexander Issajewitsch Solschenizyn (1918-2008) russisch-sowjetischer Romanschriftsteller, Dramatiker, Literaturnobelpreisträger, 1970, Quelle unbekannt


Leid, das Erwachsene einander im Bereich mitmenschlicher Beziehungen und gesellschaftlicher Verhältnisse auf zuweilen grausame Weise zufügen, ruft bei dem Untersucher, der sich mit menschlichen Verhaltensweisen beschäftigt, das Verlangen hervor, leiderzeugende Umstände zu verändern und ihre Ursachen wegzunehmen. Neben den Regungen des Entsetzens und der Trauer über die Unvollkommenheit der menschlichen Natur, die auch sein Teil ist, und gesellschaftlicher Ordnungen, an denen er Anteil hat, wird ihn hierbei nie das Bewusstsein verlassen, dass es zugleich auch gilt, bis zu einem gewissen Grad Unvollkommenheit zu ertragen.Leid jedoch, Kindern angetan, ist schlechthin unerträglich.  Hans Keilson (1909-2011) niederländischer Arzt, Psychoanalytiker, Psychiater, Traumaforscher, KZ-Überlebender, deutschsprachiger Dichter, Autor, 1979
 
Gewaltlosigkeit bedeutet nicht nur, auf externe physische Gewalt zu verzichten, sondern auch die interne Gewaltbereitschaft unseres Geistes zu vermeiden. Man weigert sich nicht nur, einen anderen Menschen zu erschießen, man weigert sich auch, ihn zu hassen.  Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. (1929-1968) US-amerikanischer Baptistenpastor, Aktivist, afro-amerikanischer Bürgerrechtler
 
Die Evolution der Menschheit wird durch Gewalt charakterisiert, etwas das Erich Fromm "bösartige Aggression" nannte. Es ist grundsätzlich anders als die Art von Aggression, die man in der Natur sieht: Überleben, Beschaffung von Nahrung oder sexueller Wettbewerb. […] Diese bösartige Aggression bedeutet nach Fromms Verständnis auch eine Art unstillbare Gier, die Tendenz, immer mehr haben zu wollen, mehr Macht, mehr Geld, mehr Besitz, mehr Territorium. Das ist charakteristisch für die menschliche Geschichte.

Terrorismus


So etwas wie "internationalen Terrorismus" gibt es nicht. Dem "internationalen Terrorismus" den Krieg erklären ist Unsinn. Politiker, die das tun, sind entweder Narren oder Zyniker und wahrscheinlich sind sie beides. Terrorismus ist eine Waffe. Wie eine Kanone. Wir würden über einen, der der "internationalen Artillerie" den Krieg erklärt, lachen. Eine Kanone gehört zu einer Armee und dient den Zielen dieser Armee. Die Kanone der einen Seite schießt auf die Kanone der anderen Seite. Terrorismus ist eine Vorgehensweise. Sie wird oft von unterdrückten Völkern eingesetzt, wie zum Beispiel von der französischen Resistance gegen die Nazis im Zweiten Weltkrieg. Wir würden über jeden, der der "internationalen Resistance" den Krieg erklärt, lachen.  Artikel Der Krieg ist eine bloße Fortsetzung der Politik mit anderen Mitteln.

Das Ziel dieser Energien, die sich von spiritueller Wahrheit bedroht fühlen, liegt darin, Wahrheit zu besiegen, indem sie sie untergraben und zerrütten. In der heutigen Zeit liegt das größte Einfallstor für niedere Astralkräfte auf diesem Planeten in den Medien – Fernsehen, Filme, Musik und ganz besonders Videospiele – die ganz offen das Böse in Form von Gewalt und Verführung verherrlichen. Auch durch die Verunglimpfung spiritueller Symbole, über die man sich absichtlich lustig macht, um zu schockieren, wird Unheil angerichtet.  ⚡  Dr. David R. Hawkins, Licht des Alls.

Vergewaltigungsstatistik


Aufgrund von Erhebungen geht man heute in Deutschland von mindestens 90.000 Vergewaltigungen im Jahr aus. Jede zweite Vergewaltigung passiert zu Hause [...] Der Täter ist der eigene Mann oder Freund bzw. Ex-Mann.Doch nur acht Prozent aller Vergewaltigungen werden überhaupt angezeigt. Und nur bei jeder siebten Anzeige steht am Ende die Verurteilung des Täters. Gleichzeitig signalisieren die Statistiken, dass Vergewaltigung das Verbrechen mit den geringsten Falschanschuldigungen ist: Nur in drei von hundert Fällen lügt die Frau. Was bedeutet: Nur jeder hundertste Vergewaltiger muss auch dafür büßen. Vergewaltigung ist also ein quasi strafloses Verbrechen.

Anonymität von erwachsenen Vergewaltigungsopfern gewährleistet den Fortbestand des Tabus und Tätern Straffreiheit.


[D]ie patronisierende viktorianische Gepflogenheit, Frauen nicht zu identifizieren, die Anklage wegen Sexualverbrechen erheben [ist uns geblieben]. Diese Konvention stellt nicht nur eine Beleidigung der Frauen dar, sondern erschwert die Strafverfolgung wegen Vergewaltigung erheblich. Überwiegend erweist Anonymität Institutionen einen Dienst, die Vergewaltiger oder Personen, denen sexuelle Belästigung vorgeworfen wird, nicht strafrechtlich verfolgen wollen. So hält etwa das US-amerikanische Militär die Identität von Personen geheim, die Anklage wegen Vergewaltigung erheben und Vergewaltigung ist bei den US-Streitkräften heutzutage weit verbreitet. Durch das Festhalten an anonymisierten Beschuldigungen können es die Militärbehörden vermeiden umfassende Aufzeichnungen zu führen, was es den Zuständigen wiederum erlaubt, die Verantwortung zu umgehen, für eine transparente Berichterstattung über Übergriffe und strafrechtliche Maßnahmen zu sorgen – und Sexualverbrechen ernsthaft und systematisch zu verfolgen. Das Gleiche gilt für Universitäten [und Kirchen]. Es ist schon längst überfällig, Anonymität für Personen, die Anklage wegen Vergewaltigung erheben, ad acta zu legen.

Good, passive people – programmed to the bystander effect


The reason that most people do nothing is that they respect every mother in the world who tells their child: "Mind your own business. Don't get involved."

Aung San Suu Kyi (*1945) is a Burmese opposition politician, leader of Myanmar’s democracy movement, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.

[M]y heroine […] is Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma. She was leading a group of students on a protest in the streets of Rangoon. They came around a corner faced with a row of machine guns. And she realized straight away that the soldiers with their fingers shaking on the triggers were more scared than the student protesters behind her. But she told the students to sit down. And she walked forward with such calm and such clarity and such total lack of fear that she could walk right up to the first gun, put her hand on it and lower it. And no one got killed.

Insights
I consider [Humanistic Psychology] to be transitional, a preparation for still 'higher' psychology, transpersonal, transhuman, centered in the cosmos rather than in human needs and interest, going beyond humanness, identity, self-actualization, and the like. Without the transcendent and the transpersonal, we get sick, violent, and nihilistic, or else hopeless and apathetic. We need something 'bigger than we are' to be awed by and to commit ourselves to in a new, naturalistic, empirical, non-churchy sense.  Abraham Maslow (1908-1970) US American transpersonal psychologist, happiness researcher, Toward a Psychology of Being, S. iv, Wiley, 1st edition 1962, 3rd edition 9. November 1998
 
When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European, or anything else, you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent? Because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence. So a man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion, to any political party or partial system; he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind.

The mechanism of tyranny always has to have both an external and an internal enemy to thrive. And it doesn't matter how contrived the internal enemy is or for that matter the external one. Tyranny is always the last refuge of a culture, civilization, or nation in decline. It never ever works. […] It's an epistomological warfare [between the Hermetic/Platonic view or the materialistic/Asristotelean view].  Audio interview with Joseph P.

From the crises in the Middle East to mass shootings in U.S. schools to the reckless striving for wealth and world domination, there is one overarching theme that almost never gets media coverage – the sense of insignificance that drives destructive acts. As a depth psychologist with many years of experience, I can say emphatically that the sense of being crushed, humiliated and existentially unimportant are the main factors behind so much that we call psychopathology.

Most men are not violent but afraid to challenge other men in support of women.


The truth is most men are not violent, overwhelmingly most men are not violent. But many men are afraid to speak up or afraid to support women, and are afraid to challenge other men. And I have great admiration for those men who do.Ads don't directly cause violence against women, but they normalize dangerous attitudes, and they create a climate in which women are often seen as things, as objects. And certainly, turning a human being into a thing is almost always the first step towards justifying violence against that person, and that step is constantly taken with women and girls.

The ultimate weakness of violence is that it is a descending spiral, begetting the very thing it seeks to destroy. Instead of diminishing evil, it multiplies it. Through violence you may murder the liar, but you cannot murder the lie, nor establish the truth. Through violence you may murder the hater, but you do not murder hate. In fact, violence merely increases hate. So it goes.Returning violence for violence multiplies violence, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. Hate multiplies hate, violence multiplies violence, and toughness multiplies toughness in a descending spiral of destruction. [...] The chain reaction of evil – hate begetting hate, wars producing more wars – must be broken, or we shall be plunged into the dark abyss of annihilation.  Martin Luther King, Jr. (1929-1968) US American Baptist minister, activist, leader of the African American civil rights movement, Strength to Love, 1963
 
Violence never brings permanent peace. It solves no social problem: it merely creates new and more complicated ones. Violence is impractical because it is a descending spiral ending in destruction for all. It is immoral because it seeks to humiliate the opponent rather than win his understanding: it seeks to annihilate rather than convert. Violence is immoral because it thrives on hatred rather than love. It destroys community and makes brotherhood impossible. It leaves society in monologue rather than dialogue. Violence ends up defeating itself. It creates bitterness in the survivors and brutality in the destroyers.  Martin Luther King, Jr. (1929-1968) US American Baptist minister, activist, leader of the African American civil rights movement, Nobel Lecture, 11. December 1964

We all have the potential to be killers. We found that the people who are the most violent are those who are incapable of embracing their own potential for evil. By projecting their shadow, their evil, onto the other, they justify their violence. They think they're emphasizing their purity, or restoring their purity, by destroying someone else.

Loss of soul

Compensated on nonintegrous outlets

It has been said that the great malady of the twentieth century, implicated in all of our troubles and affecting us individually and socially, is "loss of soul." When soul is neglected, it doesn’t just go away; it appears symptomatically in obsessions, addictions, violence and loss of meaning.

Result of 25 years of research on violent prisoners at Harvard Medical School :

Even the most violent of criminals can be rehabilitated.

There is no human being that cannot be reached. [Violent criminals are] "love-starved." Without love, the soul cannot survive. It dies. That's what these men [violent criminals] were telling me. Their souls had died. That's why they were capable of killing other people. [...] I have seen the most violent people we have. When I first started out with many of them, I thought they were hopeless. I thought there was nothing we could do. They were untreatable, incurable. [...] I was wrong. I've known some of these men for 25 or 30 years now, people who were off the scale, who were mute, paranoid, multiple murderers, who'd been killing people even after they got into prison or jail – we were able to work with [them], and turn [them] around, so that they haven't harmed a hair on anybody's head for the last 25 years, and in fact are engaged in constructive work.

Objectification is a critical reason why an abuser tends to get worse over time. As his conscience adapts to one level of cruelty – or violence – he builds to the next. By depersonalizing his partner, the abuser protects himself from the natural human emotions of guilt and empathy, so that he can sleep at night with a clear conscience. He distances himself so far from her humanity that her feelings no longer count, or simply cease to exist.  Lundy Bancroft, US American consultant on domestic abuse and child maltreatment, workshop leader, author, Why Does He Do That?

Falsely gendered his-story


We have been wedded to a false story of human nature. And it’s a falsely gendered story. It’s a wrong story about men, and boys, it’s a wrong story about girls and women. And if you think about it for one nanosecond, you know it’s wrong. Because to say that men think and women feel – in other words that men don’t feel and women don’t think, or that men have selves, and women have relationships. […] Because if you don’t have a self, then who is in relationship? Or that our minds are separated from our bodies. In other words it’s something that’s so obviously wrong as a description of human experience, that the interesting question is: How come people keep talking about it?

In 1999 Sweden passed a sex equality law.

In 1999 Sweden passed a sex equality law criminalising the buying but not the selling of sex. That way Sweden contextualizes prostitution not as men's right but as 'violence against women.

Sweden made purchasing sex [by men] a crime and then they enforced it together with extending some help, yet not enough, to those [women] who want to leave [prostitution]. Eliminating her criminality raises her status and penalizing him [the buyer as well as third party profiteers] lowers his privilege. Now Sweden arrests or surveils buyers [of prostitution]. And the results have been cutting street prostitution in half or more and they have the lowest trafficking rate in Europe. The stigma of prostitution may be shifting to the John. […] That [sex equality law] is the only legal approach to prostitution that has ever even partly worked in the history of the world. In contrast, when prostitution is legalized, trafficking goes through the roof. And illegal prostitution [for a range of reasons] escalates dramatically. […] Legalized prostitution [as introduced in Germany in 2002] is a failed experiment.

Satanic forces opting to corrupt the creative force in women and the purity in children


Question: Why is there so much physical, emotional and sexual violence against women or children?Answer: Women create. Women create life. And if you can affect the energy of the Divine Feminine then you can fracture that beauty. That is why these evil people have violence towards females because they are fearful of the Divine energy. Lots of males who abuse women would laugh about that, but the reality is that when men are violent of any sort against the female it's because they have lost the argument. It's because they are scared and they can't say that at the Divine Feminine.Violence against children is because children are seen as pure and uncorrupted. And if you can corrupt something that is pure then if you're in a Satanic organization you get points for corrupting X, Y and Z. The 3D take is that women and children are weaker. So evil men will bully or oppress that which is weaker. And that works as well. Women have been attacked by the church. The Catholic Church in particular didn’t want women anywhere near churches and organizations. […]The command and control systems on the plante have consistently tried to push women into subservient roles. […] Why would they not let a women vote? Is it because they were not as intelligent as men? Or is it because they were more intelligent than men and therefore they were harder to manipulate?That is how Satanic energies work. It's always women and always children they would attack. And it's evil and it's wrong and it has to stop.

Wounds of patriarchy:

Shaming of masculinity triggers violence, shaming of femininity silences women.

Violence occurs when women's voices are silent or silenced. […] Girl's voices and women's voices will give words to something that is felt deeply also by men but often not in language. And when women's voices drop out of the conversation this awareness and this knowledge tends to drop out with it.

Dopamine effect on male brains


This dopamine effect explains why pornography tends to become more and more extreme over time: ordinary sexual images eventually lose their power, leading consumers to need images that break other taboos in other kinds of ways, in order to feel as good. Moreover, some men (and women) have a "dopamine hole" – their brains' reward systems are less efficient – making them more likely to become addicted to more extreme porn more easily.As with any addiction, it is very difficult, for neurochemical reasons, for an addict to stop doing things – even very self-destructive things – that enable him to get that next hit of dopamine.

Porn[ography] tells you that material inequality between women and men is not the result of an economic system. It is biologically based. And women, being whores and bitches and only good for sex, don't deserve full equality. Porn is the ideological mouthpiece that legitimizes our material system of inequality. Porn is to patriarchy what the media is to capitalism. […] Pornography has socialized a generation of men into watching sexual torture. You are not born with that capacity. You have to be trained into it. Just like you train soldiers to kill. If you are going to carry out violence against a group you have to dehumanize them. It is an old method. Jews become kikes. Blacks become niggers. Women become cunts. And no one turns women into cunts better than porn.Women are told in our society they have two choices. They are either fuckable or invisible. To be fuckable means to conform to the porn culture, to look hot, be submissive and do what the man wants. That's the only way you get visibility.

Fuse with your persecutory alter ("Terrifying Mommy"),

to kill the victim alter ("Bad Child").

When security forces beat up, arrest, or even shoot unarmed activists, there is, indeed, safety in numbers.

They do strikes, they do stay-at-home demonstrations, they bang on pots and pans, they shut off the electricity at a coordinated time of day – these tactics are much less risky. They're very hard or at least very costly to suppress, while the movement stays just as disruptive.

But get this: every single campaign that exceeded that 3.5 percent point was a nonviolent one. The nonviolent campaigns were on average four times larger than the average violent campaigns.

Neuroscientific research will change the way rape is perceived and prosecuted.

Ending male dominated social control and culture of shame

[A] strong body of data now show that the harm or injury of "nonviolent" rape goes far beyond what we (or the courts) have realized. Rape or sexual abuse that women may have experienced can change minute aspects of their bodies' and minds' very functions. It can alter, for example, the operation of their baseline autonomic nervous systems, so that raped women in one study (by Rellini and Meston36) have different physiological responses to erotic videos and even to physical exercise than a control group of women who have not been so traumatised. Further, a researcher named Dr Burke Richmond37 has found a constellation of seemingly unrelated medical symptoms – from "phobic postural sway", which allows a woman literally to be more easily pushed over, to tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and perceptual problems such as vertigo – which last for years after a "nonviolent" rape.

The myth of supremacist ‘real men’


The capacity for control is a cultural standard against which all men are measured and judged, especially by other men, who authorize their standing as ‘real men’ among men, a status that sets them apart from and above women who are presumed to lack a manly capacity for control, especially over their emotions. Men are presumed to be superior to women because of men’s supposed ability always to be in control – to be tough, logical, dispassionate, objective, and decisive; to be in charge of themselves and whatever situation they’re in; to always be right, to never quit, give in, back down, accept defeat, admit a mistake, or in any other way be vulnerable. And, if necessary, to be violent.  Allan G.

Testosterone is not destiny; despite what the peddlers of third-rate evolutionary psychology sometimes insist.

In mainstream American culture, we teach boys and men that they should be violent, or at least ready to be violent if it becomes necessary.

Bundy’s emotional response the morning after his first murder

Desensitized by hard core pornography and alcohol Bundy was "possessed" by "a separate entity inside" when he raped and murdered and engaged in necrophilia.

Even all these years later, it is difficult to talk about. Reliving it through talking about it is difficult to say the least, but I want you to understand what happened. It was like coming out of some horrible trance or dream. I can only liken it to (and I don’t want to overdramatize it) being possessed by something so awful and alien, and the next morning waking up and remembering what happened and realizing that in the eyes of the law, and certainly in the eyes of God, you’re responsible. To wake up in the morning and realize what I had done with a clear mind, with all my essential moral and ethical feelings intact, absolutely horrified me. Hands at the Cuevas de las Manos upon Río Pinturas, near the town of Perito Moreno, Santa Cruz Province, Argentina, 12. August 2005
The most damaging kind of pornography – and I’m talking from hard, real, personal experience – is that that involves violence and sexual violence. The wedding of those two forces – as I know only too well – brings about behavior that is too terrible to describe. I’m not blaming pornography. I’m not saying it caused me to go out and do certain things. I take full responsibility for all the things that I’ve done. That’s not the question here. The issue is how this kind of [pornography] literature contributed and helped mold and shape the kinds of violent behavior.In conjunction with my exposure to pornography, alcohol reduced my inhibitions and pornography eroded them further. [Pornography] fuels this kind of thought process.38 Then, at a certain time, it is instrumental in crystallizing it, making it into something that is almost a separate entity inside.I’ve lived in prison for a long time now, and I’ve met a lot of men who were motivated to commit violence. Without exception, every one of them was deeply involved in pornography – deeply consumed by the addiction. The FBI's own study on serial homicide shows that the most common interest among serial killers is pornography. It’s true.39

Addiction to sexual violence induced by pornography and alcohol had Bundy commit capital crimes.


My experience with pornography … is once you become addicted to it, (and I look at this as a kind of addiction like other kinds of addiction), I would keep looking for more potent, more explicit, more graphic kinds of material. Like an addiction, you keep craving something that is harder, something which gives you a greater sense of excitement. Until you reach a point where the pornography only goes so far, you reach that jumping off point where you begin to wonder if maybe actually doing it would give you that which is beyond just reading or looking at it.

Beware of media-transmitted sexual violence


Pornography can reach out and snatch a kid out of any house today. It snatched me out of my home 20, 30 years ago. I'll tell you, there are lots of other kids playing in streets around the country who are going to be dead tomorrow and the next day and the next day and next month, because other young people are reading the kinds of things and seeing the kinds of things that are available in the media today.Those of us who have been so influenced by violence in the media, particularly pornographic violence, are not some kind of inherent monsters. We are your sons and husbands. We grew up in regular families.There are those loose in their towns and communities, like me, whose dangerous impulses are being fueled, day in and day out, by violence in the media in its various forms – particularly sexualized violence. What scares me is when I see what’s on cable TV. Some of the violence in the movies that come into homes today is stuff they wouldn’t show in X-rated adult theatres 30 years ago.There are forces at loose in this country, especially this kind of violent pornography, where, on one hand, well-meaning people will condemn the behavior of a Ted Bundy while they're walking past a magazine rack full of the very kinds of things that send young kids down the road to being Ted Bundys. That’s the irony.That is the most graphic violence on screen, especially when children are unattended or unaware that they could be a Ted Bundy; that they could have a predisposition to that kind of behavior.

 Quotes by David R. Hawkins

⚠ Caveat See Power vs. Truth, January 2013

 (↓)
The spiritual non-violent approach


Violence is force, but since [Mahatma] Gandhi was aligned with power instead of force, he forbade all use of violence in his cause. And because he expressed universal principles (which calibrate at 700) he was able to unite. When the will of the people is so united by and aligned with universal principle, it’s virtually unconquerable. Colonialism (calibrated at 175) is founded in the self-interest of the ruling country, Gandhi demonstrated, for the world to witness, the power of selflessness versus the force of self-interest.  Dr. David R. Hawkins, Power vs. Force. The Hidden Determinants of Human Behavior, chapter 10 Power in Politics, S. 152, Hay House, February 2002
 
Spirit equates with Life; the energy of life itself can be termed spirit. Spirit is the alive-ness that accompanies and is an expression of alignment with life energy. The power of high energy attractor patterns is anabolic, sustaining life: their opposites are catabolic, eventually leading to death. True power equals life equals spirit, whereas force equals weakness equals death. When an individual has lost or lacks those qualities we term spiritual, he becomes devoid of humanity, love and self-respect, perhaps selfish and violent.  Dr. David R. Hawkins, Power vs. Force. The Hidden Determinants of Human Behavior, S. 180, Hay House, February 2002
 
Characteristically, devotees tend to be introspective, thoughtful, reflective, curious, responsable, and attentive. There is usually an aversion to violence, cruelty, nonintegrity, and the fanfare and drama of glamour and vulgarity. There is an attraction to learning for its own sake and the pleasure of discovery of basic premises.  Dr. David R. Hawkins, Discovery of the Presence of God. Devotional Nonduality, S. ?, 2007 
 
Spirituality is often confused with passivity [LoC 145]. Moral obligation to respect and honor life includes one's own as well. [...] Moral stance is not the same as physical action, which in and of itself, is neutral.Full acceptance [...] does not mean becoming an apologist for grossly negative, destructive behavior. A bully may misperceive a bystander as a potential enemy, but that does not mean that one thereby allows oneself to be needlessly gored.  Dr. David R. Hawkins, Discovery of the Presence of God. Devotional Nonduality, S. 69, 2006

 Quotes by Marshall Rosenberg

No one can cause emotions in you. Another person can trigger emotions in you. However, it is your way of thinking about what they should or must do or what one usually does, what is correct or right, which causes emotions of anger, pain or annoyance.  Marshall B.

Difference between pornography and erotica


We still have not explained the difference between pornography and erotica. The words are useful. [The Greek word] pornea [sexual immorality, sexual misconduct] means female slavery. It means writing about female slavery or men playing the role of female slaves.And erotica comes from eros, and has an idea of mutuality, free choice, mutual pleasure.

Pornography


Pornography is a function of injustice. And you can see how racist it is, how subject to class […] Whereever men and women are more equal there is less prostitution and whereever we are less equal there is more prostitution. […] Pimps and brothels are very repressive institutions. The sex industry worldwide is very repressive. Prostitutes worldwide have a PTSD rate of 65%. It's 5% for the normal population. For Vietnam veterans it's between 35% and 40%. Body invasion is very, very traumatizing. I discovered that ... these women have been sexually abused as children. Body invasion causes people to dissociate from their bodies, dissociate from their lives.

We've discovered in the United States that the average rapist has raped 14 times.Minute 4:24
Rape is an addiction of some men, a perversion of masculinity that depends on conquering women.Minute 4:51
 Rape is not an inevitable part of human nature. It's a compulsion to prove a false superiority to females.Minute 5:03
Pornography comes from the [ancient Greek] word porne and means female [sex] slaves.40/41Minute 11:00
From finally focussing on the market we know that prostitution and sex trafficking are neither natural nor inevitable. They are functions of inequality, of unequal power.Minute 17:36
Prostitution is not the oldest profession. There have been many cultures without prostitution. It is one of the oldest oppressions, but not the oldest profession.Minute 17:45
The overall rate of trauma and life expectancy for all prostituted women is comparable and sometimes more than men in combat.Minute 21:37
Body invasion is uniquely traumatizing, it is even more traumatizing than beating and torture.42Minute 21:54
Whereever some groups of women are sexually restricted in order to perpetuate and keep pure a particular race or class or caste ... the less valuable women are [sexually] exploited. Everyone, everyone looses.Minute·27:33

 Quotes by Andrea Dworkin et al. – Pornography and male violence

Personal avowals
I don't believe rape is inevitable or natural. If I did, I would have no reason to be here [...] Have you ever wondered why we are not just in armed combat against you? It's not because there's a shortage of kitchen knives in this country. It is because we believe in your humanity, against all the evidence.  Andrea Dworkin (1946-2005) US American sociologist, radical feminist, anti war activist, writer, most vilified of US American feminists, 1983


 Wikipedia entry: ► Anti-pornography feminism
 
Men characterize pornography as something mental because their minds, their thoughts, their dreams, their fantasies, are more real to them than women's bodies or lives; in fact, men have used their social power to characterize a $10-billion-a-year trade in women as fantasy.  Andrea Dworkin (1946-2005) US American sociologist, radical feminist, anti war activist, writer, Pornography, Men Possessing Women, Plume, 1981, 1. November 1991
 
Pornography is the essential sexuality of male power: of hate, of ownership, of hierarchy, of sadism, of dominance.  Andrea Dworkin (1946-2005) US American sociologist, radical feminist, anti war activist, writer, Pornography, Men Possessing Women, Plume, 1981, 1. November 1991
 
 Poster warning German women and girls about the danger of human trafficking in the United States, ~1900-1910
Pornography incarnates male supremacy. It is the DNA of male dominance. Every rule of sexual abuse, every nuance of sexual sadism, every highway and byway of sexual exploitation, is encoded in it.  Andrea Dworkin (1946-2005) US American sociologist, radical feminist, anti war activist, writer, Pornography, Men Possessing Women, Plume, 1981, 1. November 1991
 
Men are rewarded for learning the practice of violence in virtually any sphere of activity by money, admiration, recognition, respect, and the genuflection of others honoring their sacred and proven masculinity.  Andrea Dworkin (1946-2005) US American sociologist, radical feminist, anti war activist, writer, Pornography, Men Possessing Women, pg. 53, Plume, 1981, 1. November 1991
 
Pornography reveals that male pleasure is inextricably tied to victimizing, hurting, exploiting; that sexual fun and sexual passion in the privacy of the male imagination are inseparable from the brutality of male history. The private world of sexual dominance that men demand as their right and their freedom is the mirror image of the public world of sadism and atrocity that men consistently and self-righteously deplore. It is in the male experience of pleasure that one finds the meaning of male history.  Andrea Dworkin (1946-2005) US American sociologist, radical feminist, anti war activist, writer, Pornography, Men Possessing Women, pg. 69, Plume, 1981, 1. November 1991
 
The pornographers actually use our bodies as their language. We are their speech. [...] Protecting what they 'say' means protecting what they do to us, how they do it. It means protecting their sadism on our bodies, because that is how they write: not like a writer at all; like a torturer.  Andrea Dworkin (1946-2005) US American sociologist, radical feminist, anti war activist, writer, Women Transforming Communications. Global Intersections, SAGE Publications, Inc., 16. July 1996
 
Guys who do not watch [Internet] pornography do not exist.  Simon Lajeunesse, Ph.D., Canadian researcher, All men watch porn, scientists find: Simon Louis Lajeunesse, PhD (2009), All men watch porn, scientists find, presented by British newspaper The Telegraph, Jonathan Liew, 2. December 2009

Aftermath of childhood trauma and humiliation in a racist mysogynist culture

Rapists are men who have predominantly been traumatized in childhood by experiencing severe physical violence or sexual abuse, emotional and physical abuse and neglect. Patriarchy and apartheid created a mindset according to which (mostly black) men are NOBODIES, subhuman beings. Their anger and pain thereof is translated into violent behavior or violent tendencies.

27.6% of the questioned men admitted to having raped a woman or girl in their lifetime.
23.2% of the rapists had raped two to three women.
8.4% of the rapists had raped four to five women.
7.1% of the rapists had raped six to 10 women.
7.7% of the rapists had raped more than 10 women or girls.
9.8% of the rapists were under 10 years old when they committed their first sex crime.

 Reasons for men's leaning to violence


Five constitutions of violence prone males

༺༻ConstitutionAntidote
1.The male brain is not wired for empathy.Men can learn to become more empathic.
2.Males have higher levels of testosterone.Strengthening of family ties; encouraging fathersto stay involved with their children
3.Males generate lower levels of oxytocin.Get a good massage regularly.
4.Males have fewer friends than females.Engage in close friendships. Join a men's group.
5.Men react more violently to shame than women.Address shame. Accept it rather than denying it.

Worldwide, the suicide rate of men is 4 times higher than with females. In the U.S.A. the ratio is 4 to 18 times higher than it is for females, increasing dramatically with age.
There are more than one million people who die by suicide each year in the world, which is more people than those who die from war, terrorist attacks and homicides every year.  Lanny Berman, Ph.D., US American professor of psychology, American University (1969-1991), executive director of the American Association of Suiciology  (AAS)

Male brains are more wired for systemizing than for empathizing.


The female brain is predominantly hard-wired for empathy. The male brain is predominantly hard-wired for understanding and building systems.  Simon Baron-Cohen, Ph.D. (*1958) British professor of developmental psychopathology, departments of psychiatry and psychology, University of Cambridge, The Essential Difference. The Truth about the Male and Female Brain, Basic Books, reprint edition 18. August 2004
 
When our empathy is switched off, we are solely in the ‘I’ mode. In such a state we relate only to things or to people as if they were just things.  Simon Baron-Cohen, Ph.D. (*1958) British professor of developmental psychopathology, departments of psychiatry and psychology, University of Cambridge, The Science of Evil. On Empathy and the Origins of Cruelty, Basic Books, 1st edition 4. September 2012
 
While there is no direct tie between testosterone and human criminality, there is an indirect tie. Testosterone leads toward violence, and violence is often criminal.  James Dabbs, Ph.D. (1937-2004) US American professor of social psychology,  Georgia State University, world expert on testosterone, author, Mary Godwin Dabbs, Heroes, Rogues, and Lovers. Testosterone and Behavior, McGraw-Hill Companies, 1st edition 25. July 2000
 
Dabbs studied 4,462 men. About 10% of these test persons were high-T men.
The overall picture among the high-testosterone men is one of delinquency, substance abuse and a tendency toward excess. [High-T men] have more trouble with people like teachers while they are growing up, have more sexual partners, are more likely to have gone AWOL in the service and to have used hard drugs, particularly if they had poor educations and low incomes.  James Dabbs, Ph.D. (1937-2004) US American professor of social psychology, Georgia State University, world expert on testosterone, author, Mary Godwin Dabbs, Heroes, Rogues, and Lovers. Testosterone and Behavior, McGraw-Hill Companies, 1st edition 25. July 2000
 
The male has paid a heavy price for his masculine ‘privilege’ and power. He is out of touch with his emotions and his body. He is playing by the rules of the male game plan and with lemming-like purpose he is destroying himself – emotionally, psychologically and physically.  Herb Goldberg, Ph.D. (*1937) US American professor emeritus of psychology, California State University, Los Angeles, The Hazards of Being Male. Surviving the Myth of Masculine Privilege, Signet, original issue 1975, 10th anniversary edition 1. October 1987
 
[Paraphrased] Men have much higher suicide rates than women do and that suicide rates increase dramatically as men age. Men between the ages of 65 and 85 killed themselves almost 10 times more frequently than do women of the same age. Further, unlike women, men often "act out" their depression and become more aggressive and sometimes violent. The comedian Elayne Boosler captured these male/female differences when she observed, "When women are depressed, they eat or go shopping. Men invade another country. It’s a whole different way of thinking."  Jed Diamond, Ph.D., US American psychotherapist, author, The Irritable Male Syndrome: Understanding and Managing the 4 Key Causes of Depression and Aggression, Rodale Books, 11. August 2005
 
I have yet to see a serious act of violence that was not provoked by the experience of feeling shamed and humiliated, disrespected and ridiculed, and that did not represent the attempt to prevent or undo that "loss of face" – no matter how severe the punishment, even if it includes death.  James Gilligan, Ph.D., US American psychiatrist, former director of the Center for the Study of Violence, Harvard Medical School, author, Violence. Our Deadly Epidemic and its Causes, S. 110, Diane Publishing Co., February 1996

Shame – the most highly guarded secret of men


The secret is that they feel ashamed – deeply ashamed, chronically ashamed, acutely ashamed, over matters that are so trivial that their very triviality makes it even more shameful to feel ashamed about them, so they are ashamed even to reveal what shames them. […] Often violent men will hide this secret behind a defensive mask of bravado, arrogance, 'machismo', self-satisfaction, insouciance, or studied indifference.  James Gilligan, Ph.D., US American psychiatrist, former director of the Center for the Study of Violence, Harvard Medical School, author, Violence.

 ⚡ Rape myths – a result of cultural denial

Rape myths are prejudicial, stereotyped or false beliefs about rape, rape victims, and rapists.  Martha R. Burt, 1980
Rape myths are attitudes and beliefs that are generally false, yet widely held, and that serve to justify male sexual violence against women.  K.A. Lonsway, L.F. Fitzgerald, Rape Myths, Review Psychology of Women Quarterly, 18, pgs. 133-164, 1984
We live in a rape culture, which means that the relationships we have with each other and as members of a society are all relationships that are predicated on a power-and-control model.  Theryn Kigvamasud’Vashti, US American co-director of CARA, Communities Against Rape and Abuse (CARA), Seattle, Washington

Online pornography portraying sexual aggression as pleasurable for the victim misleads young men.


Summing up the "Rape Myth:" After examining all of the facts, former US American surgeon general Dr. C. Everett Koop (*1916) said,  "I am certain that pornography that portrays sexual aggression as pleasurable for the victim is at the root of much of the rape that occurs today. Impressionable men, many of them still in adolescence, see this material and they get the impression that women like to be hurt, humiliated and forced to do things that they do not want to do. It is a false and vicious stereotype that leads to much pain and even death for victimized women."  Mark Kastleman, US American recovered from 25 years of pornography addiction, co-founder of Candeo, author of The Drug of the New Millennium. The Science of How Internet Pornography Radically Alters the Human Brain and Body, 2001, Just a 'Harmless Hobby' and Other Myths, presented by netnanny.com, 2001-2014




Rape and sexual assault – fiction versus faction

༺༻Rape mythsF A C T S
1.Rape is unwanted sex.Rape is a violent, life-threatening crime. The vast majority of rapists are driven by motives of domination, control, and anger along with sexual attraction. Gratification is temporary.
2.Rape is a minor crime affecting only a few women.It is estimated that 1 in 8 women in United States has been or will be forcibly raped in her lifetime.69 Because of low reporting rates, it is not known how many adult men are assaulted. It is also estimated that 1 out of every 4 girls, and 1 out of every 8 boys are sexually assaulted in some way before they reach adulthood. Rape is the most frequently committed violent crime in the United States.
3.Rape is not violent.Rape is a violent crime. Many rapists carry a weapon and threaten the victim with violence or death.
4.Women incite men to rape.More than 70% of rapes are planned in advance for which the rapist is accountable. Opportunity determines the deed.
5.Rape is an impulsive, spontaneous, uncontrollable act of sexual gratification.Rapes are a premeditated act of violence [71%], not a spontaneous act of passion. The vast majority of rapists are driven by force, anger, and control, not by sexual gratification. 60% of convicted rapists were married or had regular sexual partners at the time of the assault.
6.Most rapists only rape one time.Most rapists carefully plan the crime and repeat it again and again, usually in the same area of town and in the same way – until caught.
7.Rape is a crime of passion.Rape is an act of VIOLENCE, not passion. Sex crimes hurt and humiliate.
8.The assailant cannot control him/herself.Men can control their sexual impulses.
9.There is a "right way" to respond to a rape situation.Exposed to a life-threatening crime the raped woman is best advised to follow her instincts to simply stay alive.
10.A raped woman should not dwell on the rape experience but "forget it".Victims are best served when they can talk about the assault with intimate relations and knowledgeable professionals. Those who are denied to talk about the abuse take longer to recover form it.
11.Family members support the recovery of raped woman best.When the victim's surroundings behave unsupportively or negatively [worrying about one's reputation, blaming the recoverer, withdrawal, hostility, stigmatizing, demanding secrecy] the recovery is more difficult.
12.Rape trauma syndrome is transient.Rape is a life changing experience, devastating for the mental health of victims. 31% of all raped women develop Rape-related Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (RR-PTSD) for a prolonged time.70
13.Rapists are non-white, foreigners, lower class, "criminal types."Such rapists are more likely to be prosecuted. Rapists come from all professions, classes and races.
14.One may perceive a rapist by the way he looks.Rapists may appear friendly, normal, and non-threatening. Many are young, married and have children. Rapist types and traits can be categorized.
15.Incest is rare.Incest is common on all levels. An estimated 77% of reported sexual abusers are parents (57% of which natural parents), 16% are other relatives, and 6% are non-related. The abusers are male in 60 to 95% of the cases.71
16.You cannot be assaulted against your will.Assailants overpower their victims with the threat of violence or with actual violence. Especially in cases of acquaintance rape or incest, an assailant often uses the victim's trust in him to isolate her.
17.Sexual assaults are rare deviations and concern only few people.Sexual assaults are common. Every 4th woman worldwide has been sexually assaulted once in her lifetime. Victims rarely discuss their assaults, many block them from conscious memory. The trauma may surface at another crisis or in the presence of a sympathetic person. An estimated 155,000 women in the United States were raped each year between 1973 and 1987.72
18.Rapists are sick or insane men, or abnormal perverts.In a study of 1300 convicted offenders most were well-adjusted, few were diagnosed as mentally or emotionally ill. All had a greater tendency to express their anger through violence and rage.
19.Women often make false reports of rape. Women frequently "cry" rape.Eight percent of forcible rape complaints were "unfounded," while the average of false rape and related sex offenses reports was 2 percent. [Status 1996]73 Many cases are dropped because of insufficient evidence for conviction.
20.Women fantasize about being raped.No woman fantasizes about being raped. Less than 0.7% out of 7789 questioned women phantasize of being raped.74 Fantasies about aggressive sex may be controlled and turned off if they become threatening. A person being actually raped is unable to counter the violence and end it.
21.Women secretly enjoy being raped.No woman, man, child enjoys being raped. It is a brutal intrusion on the mind, body and spirit that can result in lasting trauma.
22.Women "ask for it" by their provocative clothing or actions.Rapists look for victims they perceive as vulnerable, not for women who dress provocatively. Assuming that women provoke attacks by where they are or the way they dress is victim-blaming. No person, whatever their behavior, "deserves" to be raped.
23.Only "bad" women get raped.Of all crimes rape victims are faced with the highest suspicion and doubt. According to studies a major reason for blaming the victim of being out late at night, drinking alcohol, dress sexily, leading on is motivated by unconscious self-protection.
24.Rape only happens to young attractive women.Rape can happen to anyone at anytime. Age, social class, ethnic group and has no bearing on the person a rapist chooses to attack. Survivors range in age from infancy to old age, and their appearance is seldom a consideration.75 The rapist chooses available and most vulnerable targets [old persons, children, physically or emotionally disabled persons, substance abusers and street persons] who can easily be intimidated.76 Men are also attacked.
25.Rape only occurs outside and at night by strangers.Rape does occur anytime and anyplace, mostly during the day and at home. Over 50% of reported rapes occur in the home.77 80% of the sexual assaults reported by college age women and adult women were perpetrated by close friends or family members. There is no common profile of a rapist. Rapes are committed by people from all economic levels, all races, all occupations.
26.Sexual assaults usually occur between strangers.Over 70% of rape victims know their attackers [relatives, friends, co-workers, dates or acquaintances]. Assaults by assailants the victim knows are often not reported so the statistics do not reflect the actual numbers of acquaintance rapes.
27.Only women and gay men get raped.The vast majority of male rape victims, as well as their rapists, are heterosexual. Male rape victims represent 8% of the primary victims.78 Rapists are driven by the desire to overpower and control another person, not by sexual attraction. Male rape is not homosexual rape. Many male victims do not report the assault because they fear further humiliation.
28.Gang rape is rare.In 43% of all reported cases, more than one assailant was involved.
29.No woman or man can be raped against her or his will.In 1991, 14% of the rapes79 involved the use of a weapon. 74% involved physical force and/or threats of force. Women are often physically weaker than men and are not taught to defend themselves or to be physically aggressive. Some women are unwilling to hurt another person, especially if the offender is someone they know.
30.If the assailant, victim, or both are drunk, the assailant cannot be charged with rape.Forcing sex on someone who is too drunk to give consent is second degree rape in North Carolina. [It carries a prison sentence of up to 17 years.] People who commit crimes like rape while under the influence of alcohol or drugs are not considered free from guilt.
31.Women who are drunk are willing to engage in any kind of sexual activity.The fact that a woman has been drinking does not imply consent. Alcohol and drugs can render a woman incapable of consent.
32.Husbands don't rape their wives.Laws against spousal rape were being installed in the 80s and 90s. Most battered wives have experienced spousal sexual abuse. Estranged or ex-spouses may use rape as a form of retaliation.
33.A husband can't sexually assault his wife.Regardless of marital or social relationship, if a woman does not consent to sexual activity, she is being sexually assaulted. 14% of women are victims of rape committed by their husband.
34.Raped persons who do not report the act immediately do not consider it as a crime.There is no typical correct victim behavior. Rape victims may react desperately, calmly, aggressively. Individual behavior is no standard for credibility. Only few rape victims reveal the crime immediately to close or unknown relations or report it to the police. They choose to remain silent out of shame, fear, and to avoid possible blame. If the rape is reported to a law enforcement agency within one year of its commission it can be prosecuted years later. Most rape victims do not report, others prepare themselves up to 3-6 years to report the crime to a law enforcement agency.

 Preventing domestic and gender violence – ten attitudes of aware men



Ten appeasing attitudes of aware men

༺༻Attitude of aware menLegend
1.Approach gender violence as a MEN'S issue involving men of all ages and socioeconomic, racial and ethnic backgrounds.View men not only as perpetrators or possible offenders, but as empowered bystanders who can confront abusive peers.
2.If  a brother, friend, classmate, or teammate is abusing his female partner – or is disrespectful or abusive to girls and women in general – don't look the other way.If you feel comfortable doing so, try to talk to him about it. Urge him to seek help. Or if you don't know what to do, consult a friend, a parent, a professor, or a counselor. DON'T REMAIN SILENT.
3.Have the courage to look inward. Question your own attitudes.Don't be defensive when something you do or say ends up hurting someone else. Try hard to understand how your own attitudes and actions might inadvertently perpetuate sexism and violence, and work toward changing them.
4.If you suspect that a woman close to you is being abused or has been sexually assaulted, gently ask if you can help. 
5.If you are emotionally, psychologically, physically, or sexually abusive to women, or have been in the past, seek professional help NOW. 
6.Be an ally to women who are working to end all forms of gender violence. 
7.Recognize and speak out against homophobia and gay-bashing.Discrimination and violence against lesbians and gays are wrong in and of themselves. This abuse also has direct links to sexism (eg. the sexual orientation of men who speak out against sexism is often questioned, a conscious or unconscious strategy intended to silence them. This is a key reason few men do so).
8.Attend programs, take courses, watch films, and read articles and books about multicultural masculinities, gender inequality, and the root causes of gender violence.Educate yourself and others about how larger social forces affect the conflicts between individual men and women.
9.Don't fund sexism.Refuse to purchase any magazine, rent any video, subscribe to any web site, or buy any music that portrays girls or women in a sexually degrading or abusive manner. Protest sexism in the media.
10.Mentor and teach young boys about how to be men in ways that don't involve degrading or abusing girls and women.Lead by example.

 Transforming rankist rape culture into digntiarian consent culture


Rape is the symptom of a larger social disease.Rape is the violation of an individual's right to bodily integrity and autonomy.Rape culture80 encourages, condones and teaches sexual violence. Rape culture is the systematically rooted judgment towardsrape victims and society's acceptance of sexual assault.Rape culture is so pervasive that people have become numb to it. [Marital] rape is not about sex but about violence against women.Most miseducated rapists behave normal within a deviant culture.Toxic concepts of masculinity define masculinity as sexual conquest.Who believes rape is a problem of honor or deserved punishment is complicit to rape culture.

 

Gender binary cultures based on a gender hierarchy are fueling moral twists and violence. The psychology of abusive patriarchal societies favors rankism which forms pseudo relationships subjected to the power-and-control model. Rankist societies preclude
human dignity that allows a sense of self and
free speech expression that encourages and
love between equal partners that unites.
 
For roughly 5,000 years marriage used to be an institution where women and minorities were seen and treated as property of the state and their husbands. Living in a male dominated rape culture people are accustomed to view mainly women’s sexuality as 
⚡ Sin resulting in "expulsion of paradise"
⚡ Risk factor resulting in unwanted pregnancy or disease
⚡ Danger resulting in death
⚡ Marketable good resulting in attention and survival.
 
1 out of 5 American women has survived an attempted or completed rape.Two thirds of rape cases are not being reported.If a survivor does report, police might not investigate.Prosecutors often refuse to take up cases that the police DO recommend.If a rape case does go to trial, survivors are often re-traumatized by the process.People think rape survivors are making their claims up.Even if a rapist is convicted, he can receive an extraordinarily light sentence.
 
For millennia sex was the only currency women had to trade for their survival. Given no choice, women adopted the idea that sex is a commodity for attention, status gain, love, care, and security. In underdeveloped societies women have still no choice than to feed the longstanding rape culture resulting in the humiliating deep-seated sex barter wound.A true culture of consent requires an overhaul of longstanding gender roles. It takes into account that women are sexual beings with developmentally-appropriate and positive desire.
 
 
Providing "out there" men (i.e. somebodies) became imprinted by the idea that women (i.e. nobodies) somehow owe (submissive) sex and compliance to them. Sometimes the sheltering "superiors" become the ones second class-gender-nobodies need shelter from. Shielded men, lacking proper initiation into a heart-centered culture of dignity, adopted a misrepresented model of masculinity that shamed and turned off their own feelings of vulnerability and compassion. 
 
Rape culture, ingrained for millennia, has it that women and men fail to notice how much they actively or passively partake in severe damage. Since Western men and women are nominally equal, women no longer subscribe to sex trade concepts consciously. Nevertheless, imprinted and programmed, women subconsciously think, "I must please the man first" not minding their own standards. In subtle or gross ways women allow and comply to submission that is expected and wanted of them. They find it hard to say "no" to a man's wishes. To be real in their yes women need to be honored, supported and loved – in their no.
 
╰⊰✿ Women, listen for your internal "no". Speak it.
Regain your voice*81 which you have lost at age 11-12.82
 
╰⊰✿ Men, cherish her spoken "no". It means that she trusts you.
Men, you may not know it yet, that you want women to be real in their yes.When a woman trusts you enough to say "no" following her inner guidance, men tell her, "I love you and respect your sovereign choice." Mean it and show it – every time. Regain your heart*83 which you have lost at age 5-7.
 
That way men and women heal the relational sex wound on both sides and give birth to a more authentic world.

A husband surrenders to the NO of his wife and transforms into a new man.


Ross Woodman: It's a different masculine that can take that No [from his wife]. It's a different masculine.Marion Woodman: I had to have my freedom to make my feminine choice.RW: And when I realized that what I was in love with was your free soul that could stand to its own truth I began to see what you meant by the masculine as not power [domination], not patriarchy, but the new masculine. And I would say that was its birth.MW: Masculinity and patriarchy are not synonymous. The true masculine is not the enemy of the feminine. It's not into power [domination], the way patriarchy is into power. […]The masculine [...] is the protector of the feminine in himself as well as in the woman. And she [the woman] has also to develop her masculinity. You have a foursome relating: a developed conscious masculine and feminine in both man and woman, but reconciling those opposites is the key to a new birth.

Wounds of patriarchy: Shaming of masculinity triggers violence, shaming of femininity silences women.


Violence occurs when women's voices are silent or silenced. […] Girl's voices and women's voices will give words to something that is felt deeply also by men but often not in language. And when women's voices drop out of the conversation this awareness and this knowledge tends to drop out with it.

Fathering resolves the cult of masculinity.


 As long as there is male dominance some sex will be violent, violence will be sexualized, and children will be victimized. […] If you [men] can't get the proper dominance from grown-ups you [they] turn to [sexual abuse of] children. […] We need to understand the whole cult of masculinity. […] The way out of this cult of masculinity is men raising children as it causes them to become whole human beings. […] The fathering revolution is partly here.

Learning dignity ⇒ empathy ⇒ love ⇒ truth – Outphasing the domination/subordination dynamic of existing hierarchies


 Pornography has always presented women as objectified bodies for male sexual pleasure, but each year pornography does that with more overt cruelty toward women. The "gonzo" genre of pornography, where the industry pushes the culture's limits with the most intense sexual degradation, encourages men to see women as vehicles for their sexual pleasure, even depicting women as eager to participate in their own degradation.After more than two decades of work on this subject, I have no doubt of one truth about contemporary pornography: It is one way that men’s capacity for empathy can be dramatically diminished.Empathy is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the work that challenges the domination/subordination dynamic of existing hierarchies, and transcending that dynamic is crucial if there is to be a just and sustainable future.

 Appeasing the demons – as practiced by Tsultrim Allione


Appeasing the demons is an ancient Buddhist practice. Continually feeding of the outer and inner demons and the elated and egocentric demons with wisdom nectar will eventually transform them for the better.
 
Female US American Lama Tsultrim Allione was recognized in Tibet as an incarnation of Machig Lapdrön, the eleventh century yogini. She is the author of Feeding your demons. Ancient Wisdom for Resolving Inner Conflict
84 and Women of Wisdom85
 
As an expert in transforming demons she suggests:
"Take the paradigm of feeding rather than fighting our own inner demons."
 
Allione adapted the wisdom of Tibet's greatest female spiritual master Machig Lapdrön, who lived in the 11th century. The story of Machig goes that the demons were so moved by her fearlessness and by her generosity, compassion, and the stability of her meditation that they said to her, 
"Not only will we not harm you, but we will become your protectors and we will protect all of those who follow you."
 
The controversial and extremely successful teacher of her time Machig Lapdrön differentiated four types of demons:


StageType of demonWhat & WhoDescriptionExpression
1.Outer demonsStrategyObject related, perceived by the senses, one's own reaction to itReaction to a car accident, a mean relative, a boss; feeling threatened by a wild animal
2.Inner demonsStrategyNot object related, no sensous contact. They keep running like the mind does.Depression, overeating, (serious) illness, addiction, fear of abandonment, anxiety, anger, greed, envy, obsession
3.Demon of elationStrategyAbuse of power by achieved successful peopleAmazing dreams, ego inflation, pride, abuse of power, fame, megalomania, self-centeredness
4.Core demon of egocentricityStrategizerArrogance, self-centeredness (at the core of all demons, most difficult to transpire its pervasiveness, normality)Amazing dreams, ego inflation, pride, abuse of power, fame, megalomania, self-centeredness

Demons (disturbed aspects) are blocking the full presence in the moment.
 
The process of appeasing the inner demons
Meet your demon. Locate it in your body, sense it in color and in texture.
Intensify it and see your demon as impersonated.
Let it arise unedited, be it in humanoid or monstrous form. 
Notice its details.
Look into your demon's eyes once you have it in front of your mind's eye and ask it:
What do you want? – Addiction (demands)
 What do you need? – Deficiency mode (requests)
 How will you feel if you get what you need? – Sense of relief (redemption)
 
Change places with where you saw the demon.
Adopt the shape and size and the emotional quality of the demon.
Now answer the questions raised above.
 What do you want? –  Icecream!
 What do you need? –  Security, comfort, relaxation
 How will you feel if you get what you need? –  Sense of security and relief
Wisdom nectar qualifies as an answer to the third question. 
 
The protocol of appeasing the inner and outer demons is:
Feed the demon with wisdom nectar to the point of its satisfaction until the demon morphs or even dissolves completely. The remaining figure will be your ally.
Now meet the ally. Or call in the ally in to appear.
Ask the ally how it will protect you and how you can contact it.
Then ask the ally the series of three questions as above.
Change places, the seat of the ally, and answer the series of questions posed to the ally.
Come back to your original seat. 
Then the ally will dissolve into you.
Feed the ally with wisdom nectar to the point of its satisfaction.
Both you and the ally will dissolve into awareness.


Often people attempt to live their lives backwards. They try to have more things or more money in order to do more of what they want so that they will be happier. The way it actually works is the reverse. ⚑ You must first be who you really are  ⚑ then do what you need to do ⚑ in order to have what you want.

 Taming violent young elephants


          Taming wild young elephants with ear flapping elders         
 
Young bull elephants [in Africa] were acting strangely out of character – antisocial and aimlessly vio­lent; they were stomping on VWs, pushing over trees for no reason, and even killing other small animals and baby elephants. [*]
 African elephant with ears spread in a threat or attentive position
Park rangers came in to study the problem [...] they discovered that there were no older bull elephants in that area. By some accident, all the older bulls had either died or been poached for their ivory, which left the teenage males to roam and forage out of control.
 
 Their solution?86
 
 They brought in some older bulls from other areas by helicopter, lowered them onto the scene, and in a mat­ter of weeks, amazingly, the whole situation had changed. Apparently, all the old bulls did was wave their ears and make various sounds or small charges, and somehow the younger male elephants understood through these com­munications that their behavior was not exactly the way growing up elephant boys should act. It seemed to be just that simple. Things soon returned to normal once the elders operated as elders.
 
[*] The violent acting out of young elephant bulls is due to the so called musth.

 Facts, myths, and signs of bullying at school, at the workplace, in the cyberworld



Features of bullying

FACT or MYTHStatements made on bullyingLegend
FACTPeople who bully have power over (apply force) unto, dominate) those they bully.Bullies usually pick on those who have less social power (peer status), psychological power (know how to harm others), or physical power (size, strength).Some bullies also have been bullied by others. People who both bully and are bullied by others are at the highest risk for problems (such as depression and anxiety) and are more likely to become involved in risky or delinquent behavior.
FACTSpreading rumors is a form of bullying.Spreading rumors, name-calling, excluding others, and embarrassing them are all forms of social bullying that can cause serious and lasting harm.
MYTHOnly boys bully.Verbal, social, and physical bullying happens among both boys and girls, especially as they grow older.
MYTHPeople who bully are insecure and have low self-esteem.Many people who bully are popular and have average or better-than-average self-esteem. They often take pride in their aggressive behavior and control over others. They may be part of a group that deems bullying okay. Some people who bully may also have poor social skills and experience anxiety or depression. They may use bullying as a way to gain social status.
MYTHBullying usually occurs when there are no other students around.Students witness about four out of every five bullying incidents at school. Bystanders give the bullying students positive attention or join in about three-quarters of the time. Although 9 out of 10 students say there is bullying in their schools, adults rarely see bullying, even if they are looking for it.
MYTHBullying often resolves itself when you ignore it.Bullying reflects an imbalance of power. Ignoring the bullying teaches bullies that they can bully others without consequences. Adults and other students need to stand up for children who are bullied, and to ensure they are protected and safe.
MYTHAll children will outgrow bullying.For some, bullying continues as they become older. Unless someone intervenes, the bullying will likely continue and, in some cases, grow into violence and other serious problems. Children who consistently bully others often continue their aggressive behavior through adolescence and into adulthood.
MYTHReporting bullying will make the situation worse.Research shows that children who report bullying to an adult are less likely to experience bullying in the future. It is beneficial for adults to encourage school children to help keep their school safe and to tell an adult when they see bullying.
MYTHTeachers often intervene to stop bullying.Adults often do not witness bullying despite their good intentions. Teachers intervene in only 14 percent of classroom bullying episodes and in 4 percent of bullying incidents that happen outside the classroom.
MYTHNothing can be done at schools to reduce bullying.School initiatives to prevent and stop bullying have reduced bullying by 15 to 50 percent. The most successful initiatives involve the entire school community of teachers, staff, parents, students, and community members.
MYTHParents are usually aware that their children are bullying others.Parents play a critical role in bullying prevention, but they often do not know if their children bully or are bullied by others. To help prevent bullying, parents need to talk with their children about what is happening at school and in the community.

 Workplace bullying


Study results of Workplace Bullying Institute

⚑ 96% of American employees experience bullying in the workplace.
⚑ Up to 85% of employers ignore bullying complaints.
⚑ Upwards of 35% of women in the workplace are frequent targets of bullying.
Victims of workplace bullying: ◊ Stereotypically not timid, defenseless, but most respected co-workers at the company◊ who work hard, ◊ are outspoken, and ◊ show a sense of influence within the company. ◊ They are doers, independent thinkers and confident, which bullies find threatening.
Perpetrators of workplace bullying: In small companies, many times bosses or CEOs are the bullies.Reason: There is little accountability and no one to challenge that person's authority.

 

Countermeasures to workplace bullying

♦ Catalogue all discretions, what the bully is doing to cause distress or violation of policy.   Document dates and times, and the what, how and when.
♦ Schedule a meeting with the HR office, the designated party to deal with workplace bullying.
♦ If a zero-tolerance policy is NOT in place, then outside litigation can be an option.
♦ Call the union representative to sit in on the meeting with HR.

 Childhood bullying resulting in psychiatric illness in early adulthood

Various studies found that the activity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis with bullying victims tends to be altered. The altered cortisol response thereof increased the risk for developing depression.Copeland's 2012 study Adult Psychiatric Outcomes of Bullying and Being Bullied by Peers in Childhood and Adolescence concluded that the effects of being bullied are direct, long-lasting, and pleiotropic [genetic].

 Bystander effect – withheld intervention due to diffusion of responsibility

 The Bystander effect also called Genovese syndrome is a social psychological phenomenon. 
 
13. March 1964 – Murder case of Kitty Genovese:
Two consecutive attacks on the murdered victim Kitty Genovese.
Nobody initiated a 911 call (the service did not exist then).
Story went unreported for 2 weeks.
Six eye witnesses present and
32 indirect bystanding witnesses failed to call the police.
Many of the witnesses reported that they did not realize that Kitty Genovese was actually being murdered. They believed that they were witnessing a "lover's quarrel". There is also neighborhood watch and the "mad mob effect". 
 
Two major factors are at play:
The presence of other people creates a diffusion of responsibility. Individuals do not feel as much pressure to take action.
The need to behave in correct and socially acceptable ways. When other observers fail to react, individuals often take this as a signal that a response is not needed or not appropriate.
Also, onlookers are less likely to intervene if the situation is ambiguous.

 Good, passive people – programmed to the bystander effectThe reason that most people do nothing is that they respect every mother in the world who tells their child: "Mind your own business. Don't get involved."  People get programmed not to look at evil, to mind their own business, not to get involved, not to take the heroic action. And essentially what it is we're also being programmed to be egocentric.  Expert comment by Philip G.

Study on victims of bullying [published in journal Psychological Medicine, 12/2012] showed "blunted cortisol responses to stress in bullied twins in comparison with their non-bullied co-twins."


Bullying is a serious matter, not only on the short term consequences, but it also leaves kind of a physiological change that could affect (the victim's) mental health later on.The victims [of bullying] were not reacting physiologically to stress. The non-bullied twins showed the normal response, which is secreting the stress hormone while under stress. […] If we accept the idea suggested by this study, that social environment can change DNA manipulation that is important for stress reactivity and mood regulation, then if we change that environment, if we make sure the victims are not victimized anymore, or if we give them the proper resources to cope better with the situation and get on with their lives, then we have the possibility of reversing what we are observing right now. […] This hypothesis is consistent with accumulating evidence, mainly derived from animal studies, showing that epigenetic remodeling represents a mechanism by which adverse experiences disrupt reactivity to stress and health.

 Politics of poverty and violence – Pride-guilt-shame culture of socio-economic status in the United States

Violence expert and psychiatrist James Gilligan, M.D., Ph.D. screened 107 years of US American rulership given the two party system consisting of the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. To his own surprise he discovered that the Republican periods had consistently added to poverty and violence in the United States whereas the periods ruled by Democratic president consistently lowered the unemployment and homicide rates. His book Why Some Politicians Are More Dangerous Than Others, published in 2011, sheds light on his findings.

 The degree to which a person experiences feelings of shame depends on two variables: 
 the way other people are treating him (with admiration and respect, or with contempt and disdain), 
 and the degree to which he himself already feels proud or ashamed. […]
 The more a person is shamed by others, from childhood by parents or peers who ridicule or reject him, the more he is likely to feel chronically shamed, and hypersensitive to feelings and experiences of being shamed, sometimes to the point of feeling that others are treating him with contempt or disdain even when they are not. For such people, and they are the rule among the violent, even a minor sign of real or imagined disrespect can trigger a homicidal reaction.

Lack of respect and self-respect drives violence.


 The purpose of violence is to force respect from other people. The less self-respect people feel, the more they are dependent on respect from others; for without a certain minimal amount of respect, from others of the self, the self begins to feel dead inside, numb and empty. […]When people lack self-respect, and feel they are incapable of eliciting respect from others in the form of admiration for their achievements or their personalities, they may see no way to get respect except in the form of fear, an ersatz, substitute for admiration; and violence does elicit fear, as it is intended to.

 Exploitative rankist US criminal justice system – James Gilligan


 Power is of two kinds. One is obtained by the fear of punishment and the other by acts of love. Power based on love is a thousand times more effective and permanent than the one derived from fear of punishment.  Mohandas Karamchand Mahatma Gandhi (1869-1948) Indian Hindu sage, spiritual activist leader, humanitarian, lawyer, nonviolent freedom fighter, unsourced Justice that love gives is a surrender, justice that law gives is a punishment.  Mohandas Karamchand Mahatma Gandhi (1869-1948) Indian Hindu sage, spiritual activist leader, humanitarian, lawyer, nonviolent freedom fighter, insourced People with childhood histories of trauma, abuse and neglect make up almost the entire criminal justice population in the United States.  Bessel van der Kolk, Ph.D., US American professor of psychiatry, researcher in post-traumatic stress, Boston University, 200592

 
US American psychiatrist and violence/prison expert James Gilligan, Ph.D. presented an overview of two longterm fatal decisions of the US penal system:
War on drugs (people suffering trauma-based addiction),
War on crime (people subject to trauma-based deviation).
 
Both wars were declared by running president Richard Nixon (1913-1994) in 1968. Campaigning he succeeded in exploiting the anti-black (i.e. anti-Democratic) sentiment in US. His coined language "War on Crime" and "War on Drugs" were code words for "War on Blacks" plus "War on the Poor" (including poor whites).Institutionalized racism/rankism legalized the era of mass incarceration. After slavery, lynching, segregation, poll taxes had been declared illegal it was a means to re-institute white supremacy.  The Beginning of the End of Mass Imprisonment and the Misuse of Prisons as Our De Facto Mental Health Care System, S. 3

Devastating 'Three Strikes' Law in the United States


Bill and Hillary [Clinton] have been very verbal in criticizing racial profiling as a 'morally indefensible, deeply corrosive practice'. [Bill] Clinton's crime bill, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, was dubbed the 'three strikes' law and is one which has incarcerated over 2.5 million people, predominately poor people of color who could not afford lawyers during their trials. The 'three strikes' rule sent people to jail for a petty crime or a major felony. It meant prison for life on the third offense, whatever that happened to be. Clinton's solution was to 'lock 'em up and throw away the key'. Now he could claim credit for less unemployment.  Dolly Kyle, US American childhood friend and mistress of Bill Clinton, novelist,  Bill Clinton's former lover Dolly Kyle has published claims about the Clinton couple's racial politics in her new book, presented by thomhartmann.com, 5. July 2016
 
The US "prison-industrial complex" proceeded with mass incarceration i.e. a Western form of gulagization.
Mentally ill people were deinstitutionalized. Living on the streets they ended up in prison, de facto "substitute" mental hospitals without proper care facilities.
 
 Treatment of mentally ill people
In the early 19th century social reformer on behalf of the indigent insane Dorothea Dix (1802-1887) concluded that prison inmates were largely mentally ill people, not criminals. Her activism resulted in an era of humane treatment for the mentally ill.
In the late 19th century the ethnocentric and xenophobic WASP majority pressured against the moral treatment of mentally ill people. Hence, the "snake pit" era resumed.
Starting in the mid-1970s the "trans-institutionalization" era began. Prisons became the last resorts of the "mental health system".
At the beginning of the 3rd milliennium violence expert James Gilligan repeated the same conclusion as was given by Ms. Dix two centuries earlier.


1950s75% of the institutionalized mentally ill were in mental hospitals.25% in prisons and jails.
 ⚡·2011Only 5% of the mentally ill are in mental hospitals.95% of the mentally ill are in prisons/jails.

 
The rate of imprisonment in the US was mostly unchanged for the three quarters of the 20th century.
Beginning mid-1970s US steadily raised her incarceration rate: 


1975100 prisoners (+/- 20) per 100,000 US population
 ⚡ 2011More than 700 prisoners per 100,000 US population

 
In less than half a century the ethnic composition in the US prison system reversed itself:


1950s70% whites30% blacks, Latinos and others
 ⚡ 200070% blacks and Latinos30% whites and others

Note: There was no fundamental change in the patterns of criminal activity among those ethnic groups.

 
~35% of the "felonies" are a non-violent and victimless violation of the existing drug laws.
Yet nearly four million colored and poor white Americans were deprived the right to vote, often for life.
The benefactor of this strategy is the Republican party.
 

 It is not in the vested interest of the ruling class to pursue those social policies that would cut down on crime; on the contrary, it is in their interests to keep the crime rate as high as possible. The ruling class (all of whom are white, in America) is responsible, in large part, for the way in which we, as a community, have chosen to distribute our collective wealth (since they, or those who represent their interests, write the laws that constitute these choices), which is, in turn responsible for the social inequities that lead to crime and violence. At the same time, it is the ruling class that wages the so-called 'war on crime', which is really a war on the poor. James Gilligan, Ph.D., US American psychiatrist, former director of the Center for the Study of Violence, Harvard Medical School, author, Violence. Reflections on a National Epidemic, Vintage, 1st edition 29. April 1997Before our white brothers arrived to make us civilized men, ➤ we didn't have any kind of [no] prison. Because of this, we had no delinquents. Without a prison, there can be no delinquents. ➤ We had no locks nor keys and therefore among us there were no thieves. ➤ When someone was so poor that he couldn't afford a horse, a tent or a blanket, he would, in that case, receive it all as a gift. ➤ We were too uncivilized to give great importance to private property.➤ We didn’t know any kind of [no] money and consequently, the value of a human being was not determined by his wealth. ➤ We had no written laws laid down, no lawyers, no politicians, therefore we were not able to cheat and swindle one another. ➤ We were really in bad shape before the white men arrived and I don't know how to explain how we were able to manage without these fundamental things that (so they tell us) are so necessary for a civilized society.

 Norway's humane penal system

Norway's reoffending rates of former prisoners are the lowest in Europe: less than 30%. Note 1: In 2007, 14 prisons in England and Wales had reconvictions rates of more than 70%. Tendency rising since 2001.
 
  Captives at the United States military prison Camp X-Ray, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba
Bastøy Prison is a minimum-security prison on Bastøy Island, Norway, about 75 kilometres south of Oslo. Called both "holiday camp" and the world's first "human ecological prison", this island prison is housing 115 prisoners. The main requirement for its inmates is the determination to live a crime-free life on release. Bastoy's rules are: no violence, no alcohol and no drugs. 
Its reoffending rate for released prisoners is 16% (lowest record of any prison in Europe).
 
Note 2: Prison guards in Norway train for three years, whereas in England they train for six weeks only. Note 3: Norway coined the unique term Likeverd, which does not exist in other languages. "Likeverd" means "equality in dignity". The concepts of human dignity and equality have had a chance to develop organically in Norway's past history due to the circumstance that this formerly very poor country was never conquered by neighboring nations. Hence, her people were saved from prolonged subjugation.

 Culture degrading and women debasing BDSM – 50 Shades of Grey

  Diana Rigg as Emma Peel in "The Avengers" (1965-1968)
Sadomasochism is the sexual expression of despotism/tyranny. This violent, humiliating, pain-lust form of sexuality requires two "consenting" players: a dominator and a submissive. Same way despotism requires the cruel rules class and the "consenting" dumbed-down desensitized massminded people.
 
In the beginning of the Aquarian age women are being empowered winning both more influence and standing in public life, while at the same time they are more "oppressed" in even more sinister approaches.
When young girls at their 18th birthday accept the gift of a torte decorated with SM symbols in order to allow themselves to be beaten and humiliated by Mr. Supercool-Cruel, only because it has become a supposedly liberating "fashion" to do so, then they have fallen for a debasing trend and agreed to their own degradation and exploitation and that of their gender as a whole.
 
In the 60ties the English actress Diana Rigg (*1938) was given the movie name "Mrs. Emma Peel". It was deliberately chosen by movie producers along with their culture building/destroying backers and financiers. Pronounced as "Miss SM-Appeal", it calls upon the violent streak in viewers. A forerunner of designing BDSM and punk attire, Diana Rigg played both the roles of the dominatrix and the sex sklave in movies. That way she indeed influenced the modern image of women in a degrading sense.
 
The 2011 novel trilogy 50 Shades of Grey (70 million sold copies) followed by the 2015 movie with the same title are corporatist mainstream media hyped culture destroying and human degrading trash. It is not a "love"story, but a continued story of abuse with an irreal happy end between a superrich psychopath and a minor, a schoolgirl. It mirrors the way how the archetypes Pluto and Persephone (Wolf and Red Riding Hood) were engaged in an imbalanced relationship. 
 

Submissive character Anastasia Steele to dominating character Christian Grey: "Please don't hit me. I don't want you to spank me, not here, not now. Please don't."

 

American professor of family studies Amy E. Bonomi, Ph.D. found the book Fifty Shades of Grey "a glaring glamorization of violence against women."
 
  Amy Bonomi
Our systematic analysis of Fifty Shades of Grey, the first novel in the trilogy, reveals pervasive emotional and sexual violence in Christian and Anastasia’s relationship. Our analysis also shows Anastasia suffers significant harm as a result – including constant perceived threat, managing/altering her behaviors to keep peace in the relationship, lost identity and disempowerment and entrapment as her behaviors become mechanized in response to Christian’s abuse. Christian uses an interlocking pattern of emotional abuse strategies – stalking, intimidation, isolation, and humiliation – to manipulate and control every aspect of Anastasia's behavior. These strategies are consistent with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s definitions of intimate partner violence.  1
 
In two consecutive studies concerning the "50 Shades of Grey" phenomenon Dr. Bonomi concluded:
 The problematic abuse message in "Fifty Shades" creates an underlying context that normalizes abuse.  2
 
In her first study Dr. Bonomi found that 36% of the female readers of the bestselling Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy liked it whereas two thirds DID NOT.
As a result of her second study on the "50 Shades of Grey" phenomenon Bonomi concluded:
Compared to participants who didn't read the book, those who read the first 'Fifty Shades' novel were➤ 25 percent more likely to have a partner who yelled or swore at them;➤ 34 percent more likely to have a partner who demonstrated stalking tendencies; and➤ more than 75 percent more likely to have used diet aids or fasted for more than 24 hours.Those who read all three books in the series were➤ 65 percent more likely than nonreaders to binge drink – or drink five or more drinks on a single occasion on six or more days per month – and➤ 63 percent more likely to have five or more intercourse partners during their lifetime.  2
 
BI: Some people argue that "Fifty Shades" is just fantasy.Amy Bonomi: People have been making that argument about porn for a long time, but the empirical studies show that those who are interacting with porn are much more likely to hold attitudes that support violence against women and more likely to be violent against women in their own relationships.  2

Fifty Shades of Grey, the book and the movie, is a celebration of the sadism that dominates nearly every aspect of American culture and lies at the core of pornography and global capitalism. It glorifies our dehumanization of women. It champions a world devoid of compassion, empathy and love. It eroticizes hypermasculine power that carries out the abuse, degradation, humiliation and torture of women whose personalities have been removed, whose only desire is to debase themselves in the service of male lust. The film, like [the 2014 American biographical war drama film American Sniper], unquestioningly accepts a predatory world where the weak and the vulnerable are objects to exploit while the powerful are [[Wiki.Narzissmus|narcissistic and violent demigods. It blesses this capitalist hell as natural and good.  Article by Chris Hedges (*1956) US American journalist, war correspondent, specializing in American and Middle Eastern politics and societies, author, Pulitzer Prize laureate, Pornography Is What the End of the World Looks Like, presented by TruthDig, 15. February 2015
 
50 Shades is pornography. Like most pornography, the storyline is weak, the characters one-dimensional, while the sex itself graphic, detailed, but formulaic. The underlying theme to 50 Shades is something far more sinister and appalling though than your mere run-of-the-mill porn. It is pedophilia.

 Chenoweth researched 323 campaigns concerning the relative success of violent efforts versus nonviolent efforts. Her historical studies of social change movements in the 20th century proved that between 1900-2006, nonviolent civil resistance was twice as successful as violent campaigns. Civil resistance is ten times as likely to lead to democratic outcomes as violence. The so-called "3.5% rule" claims that no government can withstand a challenge of 3.5% of its population without either accommodating the movement or (in extreme cases) disintegrating it.

 "Every criticism, judgment, diagnosis, and expression of anger is the tragic expression of an unmet need.""All violence is the result of people tricking themselves into believing that their pain derives from other people and that consequently those people deserve to be punished."
Marshall B. Rosenberg (1934-2015) US American psychologist, psychotherapist, developer of Nonviolent Communication, Don't Do Anything That Isn't Play!, presented by nonviolentcommunication.com, undated
 Translating 'Have to' into 'to Choose'MR invited the audience to insult him. Someone shouted out 'dumb-ass'. He jokingly replied, "This could make me feel like a PPPPPT — pretty poor protoplasm poorly put together. When in 'jackal' mode (which most people are) we can respond to verbal abuse:1. taking it personally, feel hurt, feel guilty, feel confused, become depressed.2. judge the other person for judging us, feel angry.When in 'giraffe' mode we listen moment by moment to what's alive in us and in the other person."

Richmond, M.D., University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health ⇑38 "This dopamine effect explains why pornography tends to become more and more extreme over time: ordinary sexual images eventually lose their power, leading consumers to need images that break other taboos in other kinds of ways, in order to feel as good. Moreover, some men (and women) have a "dopamine hole" – their brains' reward systems are less efficient – making them more likely to become addicted to more extreme porn more easily.As with any addiction, it is very difficult, for neurochemical reasons, for an addict to stop doing things – even very self-destructive things – that enable him to get that next hit of dopamine."
