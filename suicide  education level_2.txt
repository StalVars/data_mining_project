      Two high-profile and high-up American bankers in London have killed  themselves in separate incidents that took place within a couple days of  each other.Gabriel Magee, 39, a senior manager at JP Morgan, jumped 500 feet to his death Tuesday from the top  of the bank’s European headquarters, the Daily Mail  reported. Responders found his body on the roof that encircles the  outside of the ninth floor.On Sunday, another American bank executive, William Broeksmit, 58,  was discovered dead in his South Kensington home. Police ruled the death  a suicide by hanging.Mr. Broeksmit had retired a year ago from his  senior-level position with the Deutsche Bank, the Mail reported.“We are deeply saddened to have lost a member of the JP Morgan  family at 25 Bank Street today,” a spokesman for JP Morgan said in an email to bank workers Tuesday. Our thoughts and sympathy with his  family and his friends.”One source who reportedly knew Mr. Magee well told the Mail  that he had been in “good standing with his bosses and  colleagues” and was “well liked.”Scotland Yard was dispatched to the scene, but is not regarding the incident as foul play.INVEST IN THE FIGHT AGAINST MAINSTREAM MEDIA BIASPresidents change and lawmakers come and go, but The Washington Times is always here, and FREE online.
