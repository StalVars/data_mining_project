Chloe Madeley has revealed she gets horrific abuse for her Instagram selfies, which she posts of her toned body.

The health fanatic, who is the daughter of TV hosts Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan, regularly uploads pictures to social media documenting her fitness.

However worryingly she revealed that she has been threatened with rape, death and âpretty much anything you can think of in betweenâ. She admitted that the abuse she received is too graphic to even repeat and can be sent through as early as 5am.

The 28-year-old has previously admitted that sheâs used to people being horrible to her though as theyâve held a grudge from the start for being the daughter of a celebrity couple.

She came third on Dancing On Ice on 2011 and in 2015 took part in The Jump and finished fifth. 

Chloe launched her own fitness app this year 'Chloe Madeley 15 Minute Fat Loss Workout' which reached number two in the iTunes charts after just a day.
